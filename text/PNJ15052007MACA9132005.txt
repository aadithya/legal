6.

7.

Loss of future enjoyment of life: Rs.70,000/-

8.

Loss of earning of father:

3.

Rs.1,80,000/-

Rs.10,000/-

Aggrieved by the amount of compensation awarded

by the Tribunal, injured has filed the present appeal.
4.

Since the only issue involved relates to quantum of

compensation, I shall only be noting such facts as are relevant
for adjudication of said issue.
5.

Injured was aged 13 years as on the date of the

accident.

He was a student of Class VIII, Bright Star Public

Middle School, Delhi.
6.

On account of injuries sustained by the injured, his
Page 2 of 9

right leg was amputated above the knee. Disability certificate,
Ex.PW-1/X1 shows that permanent disability was assessed at
80%.
7.

Discharge summary, Ex.PW-1/D1, shows that the

injured was hospitalized at G.T.B.Hospital, Delhi for the period
from 9.1.2003 to 24.6.2003 i.e. nearly 5 months.
8.

In the light of aforenoted backdrop facts, I shall

determine the 'fairness' of the compensation assessed by the
Tribunal.
9.

Broadly

speaking,

while

fixing

an

amount

of

compensation payable to a victim of an accident, the damages
have to be assessed separately as pecuniary damages and
non-pecuniary damages. Pecuniary damages are those which
the victim has actually incurred and which is capable of being
calculated in terms of money.

Whereas, non pecuniary

damages are those which are incapable of being assessed by
arithmetical calculations.
10.

Pecuniary loss may include the following:-

(i)

Special damages or pre-trial pecuniary loss.

(ii)

Prospective loss of earnings and profits.

(iii)

Medicinal expenses.
Page 3 of 9

(iv)

Cost of future care and other expenses.

11.

Non pecuniary loss may include the following:-

(i)

Pain and suffering.

(ii)

Damages for mental and physical shock.

(iii)

Loss of amenities of life which may include a
variety of matters i.e. on account of injury the
injured may not be able to walk, run or sit etc.

(iv)

Loss of expectation of life i.e. on account of
injury normal longevity of the life of the person
concerned is shortened.

(v)

Disfigurement.

(vi)

Discomfort

or

inconvenience,

hardship,

disappointment, frustration and mental stress in
life.
12.

As noted herein above, damages have to be

assessed separately as pecuniary damages and non pecuniary
damages.

In

Rs.2,18,000/-

the

instant

under

the

case,

head

Tribunal

'pecuniary

has

awarded

damages'

and

Rs.1,00,000/- under the head 'non-pecuniary damages'. I shall
deal with each head separately.
Non-pecuniary Damages:
Page 4 of 9

13.

Tribunal has awarded Rs.1,00,000/- under this head.

Break-up of the compensation awarded under this head is as
follows:(i)

Pain and suffering

:

Rs.30,000/-

(ii)
14.

Loss of future enjoyment of life :
Rs.70,000/Learned counsel for the appellant contended that

compensation awarded by the Tribunal under this head is
inadequate.
15.

Noting the extent of the injury suffered by the

appellant, his young age and the period for which he remained
hospitalized, compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- awarded by the
Tribunal under this head is on the lower side.
16.

In

so

holding,

I

note

the

undermentioned

judgments:“1.

& Anr. 2004 ACJ 1396.”
17.

From the aforenoted judicial decisions, a trend

which emerges is that between the years 1985 to 2000, courts
have been awarding about Rs.3 lac under the head 'non
pecuniary

damages'

for

amputation

of

leg

resulting

in

permanent disability of 50% and above.
18.

In the instant case, Tribunal has awarded Rs.1 lac

under the head 'non pecuniary damages'. Accordingly, I award
Rs.3 lacs under the head 'non pecuniary damages'.

Thus,

compensation under the said head is enhanced by a further
sum of Rs.2 lacs.
19.

Pecuniary damages:
Tribunal has awarded Rs.2,18,000/- under the head

'non-pecuniary damages'. Learned counsel for the appellant
has challenged the award on one count. One, compensation

Page 6 of 9

awarded by the Tribunal for loss of earning capacity is on the
lower side. Tribunal has erred in awarding no compensation
for the future medical expenses.
20.

Tribunal has awarded Rs.1,80,000/- to the injured

for the loss of earning capacity.
21.

Tribunal has assessed damages for loss of earning

capacity by applying multiplier method.
22.

Noting IInd Schedule appended to the MV Act 1988

which provides notional income of Rs.15,000/- per annum in
case of non earnings persons, learned Tribunal has taken
income of the deceased as Rs.15,000/- per annum.
23.

Considering that the injured was 13 years at the

time of the accident, Tribunal has applied multiplier of 15 as
provided under IInd Schedule.
24.

Admittedly, injured had suffered 80% permanent

disability. Tribunal has taken functional disability suffered by
the injured as 80%. Thus, total compensation is determined by
the Tribunal as Rs.15,000 X 15 X 80% = Rs.1,80,000/-.
25.

In my opinion,

Tribunal has erred in assessing

functional disability suffered by the injured at 80%.
26.

While estimating future loss of income, the effect of
Page 7 of 9

the earning capacity ought to be judged in the light of the
importance of the loss of permanently impaired limb in the
vocation or profession or employment career of the injured
person. The nature of work or business has to be considered
and the extent of disablement cannot be indifferent to the
nature of the work.
27.

In the instant case, injured was a student of class

VIII. What would have been his avocation in future cannot be
determined at this stage. However, report card of the injured
of Class VII (Ex.PW-1/H) throw some light on the same. The
said report card shows that injured was a brilliant child as
evident from the fact that he obtained 88.6% marks in Class
VII. In all probability, it can be assumed that deceased would
have taken up a white collar job in future and not a manual job.
Thus, in any case, functional disability suffered by him cannot
exceed 50%.
28.

Therefore, I see no infirmity in decision of Tribunal

in awarding Rs.1,80,000/- to the injured for the loss of earning
capacity.
29.

In view of para 19 above, net effect is that

compensation stands enhanced by a sum of Rs.2,00,000/-.

Appeal

stands

disposed

of

by

enhancing

the

compensation by a further sum of Rs.2,00,000/-.
34.

Enhanced compensation shall be paid together with

interest @ 6% per annum from date of claim petition till date of
realization.
35.

I direct that the enhanced compensation be kept in

a fixed deposit with a Nationalized Bank or a Post Office
Scheme whichever secures maximum interest for a period of 5
years.
36.

No costs.
