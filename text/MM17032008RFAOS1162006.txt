1.

This appeal arises out of the judgment dated 07th August, 2006 delivered

by the learned Single Judge declaring the plaintiff-appellant to be the owner of
1/4th share of the suit property.
2.

The facts of the case briefly stated are as follows:-

a.

The appellant and respondent no.1, 2 and 3 are related to each other.

Respondent no.3, Sh. Jawahar Singh Gambhir, is the father of the appellant and
the respondents no.1 and 2. The appellant and the respondents no. 1 and 2 are
brothers.
b.

The Respondent no.3 was the absolute owner of suit property bearing no.

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 2 of 18

6/88, WEA, Karol Bagh, New Delhi (hereinafter referred to as the ‘suit
property’).
c.

The Respondent no.3, the father,

voluntarily and out of love and

affection for his children made a gift of 1/4th share in the suit property having a
2 ½ storeyed house constructed thereon, in favour of the appellant and
respondents no.1 and 2 and respondent no.3 also retained 1/4th share in the suit
property.
d.

For the purpose of giving effect to the said gift made by respondent no.3

in favour of the appellant and respondents no.1 and 2, a gift deed dated 29th
March, 1979 was executed by the respondent no.3 and was accepted by the
appellant and on behalf of respondent no.1 and 2 by the mother Smt. Parkash
Kaur Gambhir, since at the time the respondent nos. 1 and 2 were minors. The
said gift deed was, duly registered in the office of the sub-Registrar, Delhi at
Entry No.3107 in Additional Book No.4144 on pages 89 to 93 on 26th July,
1979.
e.

The particulars of the said property are as under:

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 3 of 18

Address : 6/88, WEA, Karol Bagh, New Delhi-110005.
Measuring: 230 Sq. Yds. Being 20 ½ Sq. Yds. In length

Karol Bagh, New Delhi-5 bounded byNorth :

The said gift having been duly accepted by the plaintiff, the plaintiff also

assumed joint possession of the said property together with respondents no.1, 2
and 3.
g.

The appellant has since been continuously in possession of the said

property together with the respondents.
h.

The appellant is also jointly in possession of property bearing no.13A/6A,

measuring 160 sq. yards, WEA, Karol Bagh, New Delhi with the respondents
no.1 and 2. The appellant and respondents no.1 and 2 are having 1/3rd share in
the same. Suit No. 371/1998 for partition of the property no. 13A/6A, WEA,
RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 4 of 18

Karol Bagh, New Delhi was also filed by the appellant and is pending before
this Court.
i.

The appellant thereafter filed the present Suit No. CS(OS) No. 703/1998

for partition of the suit property at 6/88, WEA, Karol Bagh, New Delhi and for
the peaceful enjoyment of the above mentioned 1/4th share. The Hon’ble Single
Judge of this Court by his judgment dated 7th August, 2006 concluded as
follows:-

“In view of the statement made by the
defendants, I decree the suit declaring the
plaintiff to be the owner of 1/4th share of
the suit property and separate his share
by directing that 1/4th land comprised in
the suit property abutting plot No. 6/87,
would be the portion of the plaintiff.
Since it is admitted that front of plot is 34
ft., portion falling to the share of the
plaintiff would be as marked ‘A’ on the
site plain Ex.C-1.”
j.

It is against this judgment and decree dated 7th August, 2006 that the

appellant has filed the present appeal.

I am afraid, plaintiff is attempting to
play smart. For if, he were to get a strip in

want to live jointly would have to suffer.
14.
In view of the statement made by the
defendants, I decree the suit declaring the
plaintiff to be the owner of 1/4th share of the
suit property and separate his share by
directing that 1/4th land comprised in the
suit property abutting plot No. 6/87, would
be the portion of the plaintiff. Since it is

No costs.”

The counsel for the plaintiff- appellant has challenged the above

judgment and has contended that the only appropriate course of action which
should have been followed by the learned Single Judge would have been to sell
off the property and not partition it as the value of the partitioned property gets

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 8 of 18

reduced and the partition leading to the strip marked as ‘A ‘falling to the
appellant’s share is not capable of enjoyment by the appellant. The counsel for
the respondents while opposing that plea contended that the other co-owners,
who are the brothers and father of the plaintiff-appellant, do not want to sell off
the property and also wish to continue to live jointly.
5.

We have seen the plan of partition directed by the learned Single Judge

which is as follows:-

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 9 of 18

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

6.

The plaintiff-appellant has also filed another Suit No. 371/98 in respect

of the property situated at 13A/6A, WEA, Karol Bagh, New Delhi admeasuring
160 square yards. It is not in dispute that the present property is approximately
230 sq. yards and the 1/4th share of the plaintiff-appellant would not exceed 60
sq. yards in this property. The main thrust of the counsel for the appellant, Sh.
Tripathi while not disputing the fact that the suit property falls in a busy
commercial street, is that value of the property gets depressed because of the
partition. This may be so but it is the appellant himself who had claimed
partition and cannot be heard to complain about the result of the suit in his
favour.
7.

The counsel for the respondents, in addition, made an offer that for the

sake of buying peace, the respondents are prepared to give the entire property
situated at 13A/6A, WEA, Karol Bagh, New Delhi admeasuring 160 square
yards which is residential in nature, which is less than a kilometer away from
the present property to the appellant in lieu of his 1/4th share in the present
property amounting to 60 sq. yards. Both the sides agree that the suit property

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 11 of 18

is not suitable for residence as it is on a busy commercial street. The learned
counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant in fact wanted the
property for the purpose of residence. The counsel for the appellant has declined
the offer of exchange of his share of approximately 60 sq. yds. for a 160 sq.
yards plot in the vicinity of the suit property which is undoubtedly better suited
for residential purposes.

Reliance was also placed by the counsel for the

appellant on Order XX Rule 18 of the Code of Civil Procedure which reads as
under:
“Decree in suit for partition of property or
separate possession of a share therein.- Where
the Court passes a decree for the partition of
property or for the separate possession of a share
therein, then(1)
If an in so far as the decree relates to
an estate assessed to the payment of revenue to the
Government, the decree shall declare the rights of
the several parties interested in the property, but
shall direct such partition or separation to be made
by the Collector, or any gazette subordinate of the
Collector deputed by him in this behalf, in
accordance with such declaration and with the
provisions of section 54;
(2)
If an in so far as such decree relates
to any other immovable property or to movable
property, the Court may, if the partition or
separation cannot be conveniently made without

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 12 of 18

further inquiry, pass a preliminary decree declaring
the rights of the several parties, interested in the
property and giving such further directions as may
be required.”

8.

The reliance placed on the above provisions by the appellant is not

justified as the present property is also assessable for revenue payable to the
government and hence sub-section (2) cannot come to the aid of the appellants.
9.

On the question of

the powers of the Court to order sale instead of

division in partition suits this Court in the case of Faquira vs. Smt. Raj Rani
and another AIR 1984 Delhi 168 held as under: “On hearing the learned counsel, we find that there
has been a complete misunderstanding of the
procedure to be followed under the Partition Act,
1893, in the particular case. Section 2 of the Act is:
“2. Power to Court to order sale instead of
Division in partition suits.- Whenever in any suit
for partition in which, if instituted prior to the
commencement of this act, a decree for partition
might have been made, it appears to the Court
that, by reason of the nature of the property to
which the suit relates, or of the number of
shareholders therein, or of any other special
circumstances, a division of the property cannot

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 13 of 18

reasonably or conveniently be made, and that a
sale of the property and distribution of the
proceeds would be more beneficial for all the
shareholders, the Court may, if it thinks fit, on
the request of any of
such shareholders
interested individually or collectively to the
extent of one moiety or upwards, direct a sale of
the property and a distribution of the proceeds.”
This Section clearly states that the Court can order a
sale if one is demanded by the shareholders interested
individually or collectively to the extent of half the
property or more. Thus, the Court can only order a
sale if requested to do so by the owners of 50 per cent
share in the property or more and cannot order the
same on its own. There seems to be a general belief
that property subject to a partition suit can be sold
even without any such request. In this connection, it
may be recalled that the Partition Act of 1893 was
passed only with the object of giving the Court power
to sell the property, if necessary. The following
quotations from the statement of objects and reasons
in the Act are self-explanatory:
“…………..It is proposed in the present Bill to
supply this defect in the law by giving the Court,
under proper safeguards, a discretionary
authority to direct a sale where a partition cannot
reasonably be made and a sale would, in the
opinion of the court, be more beneficial for the
parties.
But, having regard to the strong
attachment of the people in this country to their
RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 14 of 18

landed possession, it is proposed to their landed
possession, it is proposed to make the consent of
parties “interested at least to the extent of a
moiety in the property a condition precedent to
the exercise by the Court of this new power. In
order at the same time to prevent any oppressive
exercise of this privilege, it is proposed to give
such of the shareholders as do not desire a sale
the right to buy the others out of a valuation to be
determined by the court.”

Thus, in view of the above position of law, the appellant who has only
1/4th share in the suit property measuring 60 sq. yards, cannot in any event, seek
the sale of the suit property.
In view of the circumstances of the case, indicating that the partition or
separation of the suit property can conveniently and justly be made as proposed
by the learned Single Judge of this Court, there is no necessity for this Court to
pass any order to sell off the suit property as the same will adversely affect the
rights of the respondents as they are the co-owners in the capacity of brothers
and father of the appellant and they do not want to sell off the property and wish
to continue to live jointly. Besides this, the respondent’s counsel had even

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 15 of 18

made an offer of giving the choice to the appellant of the location of the 1/4th
part of the land, provided the three co-owners i.e. the Respondents no.1 Sh.
Amrit Pal Singh Gambhir, Respondent no.2 Shri Inderjit Singh Gambhir and the
Respondent no.3 Shri Jawahar Singh Gambhir, who wanted to continue to
remain joint were given adjacent portions. Even this proposal was not found
acceptable to the appellant.
10.

We had also attempted to resolve the matter by asking the counsel for the

parties to suggest a settlement and the settlement as noted above for grant by the
Respondents of the entire 160 sq. yards in a nearby location suitable for
residence, to the appellant, in lieu of his 1/4th share of suit property measuring
60 sq. yards was suggested by the counsel for the respondents to have complete
separation so that there is no bitterness between the warring parties. However,
this offer of the respondents was inexplicably spurned by the appellant. On the
one hand, the appellant contends that he wants the suit property so as to
construct his residence, whereas on the other hand he declined to give up about
60 sq. yards of the suit property in a commercial area so as to get a 160 sq.

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 16 of 18

yards plot in the vicinity in a residential area. This clearly shows that the
appellant’s sole desire is to have the suit property sold.

The appellant has

backtracked from his own stand on any final agreement fructifying during the
various stages in the process of the present litigation. The Mediation Report
dated 14th February, 2006 on a possible agreement between the parties was duly
signed by all the parties including the appellant.

However, the appellant

backtracked on this agreement which can be seen from the order dated 20th
February, 2006. The impugned judgment dated 7th August, 2006 recorded noobjection of all the respondents and consent of the appellant as to mode of
partition, however, the appellant filed the present appeal thereafter. The order
dated 2nd February, 2007 observed that the appellant’s proposal was accepted by
the respondents. However, the appellant failed to appear in the court on a
number of occasions and later declined to stand by the offer given by himself.
11.

Since the property has been shown to be divisible by metes and bounds as

demarcated by the learned Single Judge and three out of four co-sharers want to
stay jointly and do not want a sale, the judgment of the learned Single Judge

RFA(OS) No. 116/2006

Page 17 of 18

cannot be faulted. Since the appellant is not prepared to accept that settlement,
which in our view appears to be generous, or make any offer save the offer of
the sale of the suit property, we see no reason as to why the impugned order
should not be sustained. Indeed we are bound in law by the position of law in
Faquira’s case, which dictum does not give a party having less than half share
to seek a sale of the family property. Accordingly, both on the law and the
facts, there is no merit in this appeal.
12.

Normally, the conduct of the appellant should have invited substantial

costs against him. However, we decline to award costs against the appellant as
this is a family matter. The appeal along with the pending applications is
consequently dismissed with no orders as to costs.
