5 cycle/scooter parking sites

measuring 375 sq.

mtrs., 625 sq. mtrs., 2419 sq. mtrs., 1625 sq. mtrs.
and 600 sq. mtrs. respectively at Ghaziabad city side

Station

on

a

total

license

fee

of

Rs.17,51,000/- for a period of two years i.e. from 1 st
April, 1999 to 30th September, 2000. The petitioner
deposited an amount of Rs.2,91,840/- as advance
license fee for four months besides security amount of
Rs.1,75,100/-.

The

balance

license

fee

of

Rs.14,59,160/- was payable in 20 equal installments
of Rs.72,958/- each. Though the petitioner deposited
the requisite amounts

and completed

all the

formalities as required, he was given possession of
only three sites measuring 375 sq. mtrs, 1625 sq.
mtrs. and 600 sq. mtrs.

to

hand

over

possession of the other two sites measuring 2419 sq.

and 625 sq. mtrs.

O.M.P. No.219/2004

It was only on 13th
Page 2 of 14

September, 2000 that the possession of 4th site of
2419 sq. mtrs. was handed over to the petitioner
though he had been paying

license fee therefor

regularly right from the very inception. Similarly, the
possession of the 5th site of 625 sq. mtrs. was handed
over to him on 30th September, 2000 only inspite of
the fact that

he had continued

therefor also from

to pay license fee

the very beginning.

Amongst

other claims before the Arbitrator the petitioner
sought refund of proportionate amount deposited on
account of license fee for the said two sites but the
respondent did not respond to his request in

that

regard. He eventually invoked the arbitration clause
in the agreement and the disputes as set out by the
petitioner in his statement of claims were thus
referred to arbitration. Apart from seeking refund of
the proportionate amount of license fee for the period
prior to handing over of possession of the 4th and 5th
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 3 of 14

sites, the petitioner also claimed an amount of
Rs.1,06,870/- on account of interest @ 24% on the
sum of Rs.5,43,813/- being the license fee deposited
by him

for the site measuring 2419 sq. mtrs. and

another sum of Rs.27,345/- @24% of Rs.1,45,082/being the license fee deposited for the site measuring
625 sq. mtrs. for the periods 1st April, 1999 to 13th
September 2000 and for 1st April, 1999 to 30th
September, 2000, respectively.

Besides, claims on

certain other counts were also made by the petitioner
but the same need no mention since the petitioner at
the time of hearing confined his challenge to the
award only with respect to his claim on account of
interest as aforesaid being not granted by the
arbitrator.
2.

The respondent denying

entitlement of the

petitioner to all his claims as set out in the statement
of claims contested petitioner's claim to any interest
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 4 of 14

as well under Claims No.4 and 5 on the plea that
since the very amounts on which interest was being
claimed were not payable to him, the question of
payment of any interest thereon does not arise. The
respondent while contesting the petitioner's claims
made

a

counter

claim

of

Rs.66,020/-

for

unauthorised use of electricity on the parking sites by
the petitioner but the same was

disallowed by the

arbitrator.
3.

The arbitrator made his award dated 22nd
March, 2004 allowing petitioner's claims being claim
No.1 and 2 directing refund of proportionate license
fee to the tune of Rs.5,43,813/- and license fee of
Rs.1,45,082/- deposited by the petitioner for the site
2419 sq. mtrs. and in respect of site measuring 625
sq. mtrs., respectively. The arbitrator however did not
award any interest on the said amounts for the period
in question falling between the date/s of allotment
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 5 of 14

and handing over of possession of the 4th and 5th
parking sites to the petitioner. The awarded amount
on account of claims No.1 and 2 was required to be
paid within 90 days from the date of publishing of the
award failing that a simple interest @6% per annum
was payable to the petitioner by the respondent.
4.

Though in his objections under Section 34 of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short
'the Act') the petitioner questioned the validity of the
award declining Claims Nos.3 to 8 and sought the
award to be set aside, at the time of hearing, learned
counsel for the petitioner restricted his challenge to
the award in regard to non-grant of interest and costs
only. It was argued that in view of petitioner's Claims
No.1 and 2 being allowed by the arbitrator he should
have also been granted interest thereon unless the
arbitrator had strong reasons for not awarding the
same. It was contended that the arbitrator omitted to
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 6 of 14

assign any reason in his award while ignoring the
petitioner's claim of interest on the amounts under
Claims No.1 and 2 and thus the award is liable to be
suitably modified to grant interest to the petitioner as
also costs of Rs.75,000/- for the proceedings before
him.
5.

The respondent contested
claim on account of

the petitioner's

interest on the plea that the

arbitrator in his wisdom did not find the petitioner's
claim for interest worth being awarded

and, in the

circumstances, no interference with the award is
called for.
6.

Under Claim No. 4 the petitioner claimed an
amount of Rs.1,60,870/- on account of interest @
24% per annum on the sum of Rs.5,43,813/- for the
site measuring 2419 sq. mtrs. for the period from 1st
April, 1999 to 13th September, 2000. Similarly, under
Claim No.5 in his statement of claims the petitioner
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 7 of 14

made a claim of Rs.27,345/- as interest @ 24 % on
the sum of Rs.1,45,082/- for the period from 1st April,
1999 to 30th September 2000. Though the Arbitrator
awarded the petitioner's claim for Rs.5,43,813/- and
Rs.1,45,082/-, but omitted to grant any interest on
the said amounts inspite of the petitioner having
made separate claim in that regard in his statement of
claims.
7.

The settled law on the point is that interest
ought to be granted in all cases where there is a
decree of money unless there are strong reasons to
decline the same (see Jagdish Rao & Bros. Vs. Union
on India, 1999 (1) ARB LR 696).

The Arbitrator

inspite of having granted the petitioner's claims No.1
and 2 in his statement of claims, omitted altogether to
deal with the aforesaid claim of the petitioner on
account of interest. In view of non-grant of interest,
the claims of the petitioner in that regard would be
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 8 of 14

taken to have been declined. Since no reasons find
mention in the award declining petitioner's claim on
account of interest, it is difficult to justify non-award
thereof by the Arbitrator.
8.

Section

31

(7)

(a)

empowers

an

arbitral

tribunal to award interest, unless otherwise agreed by
the parties, at such rate in a case where an arbitral
award

is for payment

of money,

as

it deems

reasonable, on the whole or any part of the money,
for the whole or any part of the period between the
date on which the cause of action arose and date on
which the award is made.

In M/s Jagdish Rai &

Brothers Vs. Union of India; JT 1999 (2) SC 268 the
Apex Court has ruled that interest can be granted at
four stages viz. (1) from the stage of accrual of cause
of action till filing of the arbitration proceedings, (2)
during pendency of the proceedings before Arbitrator,
(3) future interest arising between date of Award and
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 9 of 14

date of the decree and (4) interest arising from date of
decree till realisation of award amount (see also
Secretary Irrigation Department, Govt. of Orissa and
Ors. Vs. G.C. Roy; JT 1991 (6) SC 349 and B.V.
Radha Krishna Vs. Sponge Iron India Ltd; (1997)4
SCC 693).

It may be noticed

that in view of

respondent's failure to hand over possession of

4th

and 5th parking sites to the petitioner no amount of
license fee could have been chargeable in respect
thereof until possession thereof was given to him.
The respondent however even without making the
said two parking sites available to the petitioner,
continued to

charge license fee in respect thereof

between the periods in question which was eventually
held to be not justified

by the Arbitrator and

consequently refund of the amounts Rs.5,43,813/and Rs.1,45,082/- by the respondent to the petitioner
was granted by way of the impugned award. Clearly,
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 10 of 14

inspite of the respondent being not entitled to charge
license fee for the said two sites for the periods when
the possession of such sites had not been

made

available to the petitioner, withholding of that amount
and not refunding the same even on request being
made by the petitioner in that regard, rendered it
liable to compensate the petitioner for depriving him
of making use of that amount. In the given situation
non-grant of interest, without strong reasons, would
not appear to be justified. The award is thus liable to
be modified so as to grant interest on the awarded
amount for the pre-reference period as aforesaid.
9.

The petitioner would appear to have been well
within his rights to seek refund of the license fee paid
by him for the period the two parking sites had not
been made available to him inspite of his repeated
requests. The respondent however did not accede

to

such a justified payment from him and thereby forced
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 11 of 14

him to invoke the arbitration clause for adjudication
of disputes between him and the respondent by an
arbitral tribunal.
respondent
petitioner

In the circumstances, it was the

which was responsible for making the
to

take

recourse

to

adjudication

by

reference to arbitration. The expenses incurred by
him in the process should have thus been held
recoverable from the respondent.

The Arbitrator

however, inspite of being empowered in that regard
under Section 31 (8) of the Act, omitted to exercise
his power in this respect and did not award any costs
to the petitioner even though a separate claim for the
same had been made.

Grant or non grant of costs

should normally abide by final outcome of the
proceedings.

It is not a case where the petitioner

inspite of being partially successful could be held to
have been dis-entitled to costs by virtue of terms of
agreement between him and the respondent.
O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 12 of 14

Since

an unjustified omission on the part of the respondent
to refund the license fee realised by it compelled the
petitioner to

invoke arbitration proceedings, the

expenses incurred by him on this score are liable to
be recovered from the respondent. As the Arbitrator
ignored the

petitioner's claim on this count, the

award is liable to be modified so as to include
payment of reasonable costs of the proceedings to the
petitioner.
10.

In view of the above allowing the petitioner's

Claim Nos. 4 and 5 interest @10% per annum on
Rs.5,43,813/- and Rs.1,45,082/-, for the periods 1st
April, 1999 to 12th September, 2000

and 1st April,

1999 to 29th September, 1999 respectively is granted
in favour of the petitioner and against the respondent.
Besides, an amount of Rs.35,000/- is awarded
towards costs under Claim No. 8. The award dated

O.M.P. No.219/2004

Page 13 of 14

22nd March, 2004 shall stand modified accordingly.
The petition is thus disposed of in the aforesaid
terms.
