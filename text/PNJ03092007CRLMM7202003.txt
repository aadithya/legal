Page 1 of 10

petitioner, his father and his wife under Sections 419, 420, 467,
468, 471 and 120 B IPC. (It is to be noted that father of the
petitioner has died).
3.

Basis of the complaint were the allegations that the

accused persons committed the offence of cheating, fraud,
forgery and impersonation with an intent to grab the house
property of the father of the complainant, Nand Lal Chugh.
4.

It was inter alia averred in the complaint that:-

A.

Nand Lal Chugh was the owner of the property

bearing No. H-229, Jeewan Niketan, Paschim Vihar, New Delhi.
B.
petitioner

With an intent to grab above mentioned property,
C.L.Manchanda

fabricated

a

document

called

'business agreement' purported to have been executed at
Bihar Sharif, Nalanda, Bihar between the petitioner as the first
party and complainant and his father as second party.

The

document recorded that the petitioner is the owner and in
possession of property bearing No. H-229, Jeewan Niketan,
Paschim Vihar, New Delhi and had advanced a loan in sum of
Rs.30 lacs and handed over the possession of the aforesaid
property to the complainant.

It was further recorded that

towards discharge of his liability complainant would pay a sum
of Rs.50,000/- per month to the petitioner as the usage
Page 2 of 10

charges. The terms of the agreement provided for referral of
any dispute between the parties to an arbitrator.

The

signatures of complainant and his father were forged on said
document.
C.

On

the

basis

of

aforenoted

forged

'business

agreement', arbitration proceedings has been shown to have
taken place. Another document namely 'arbitration reference'
was fabricated by the petitioner. This document records that
the dispute arose between the petitioner and the complainant
and thus as per the terms of the aforesaid 'business
agreement', a person by the name of Avtar Singh has been
pointed as the sole arbitrator. This document has been shown
to have been executed on 13.9.1992 and also contains the
forged signatures of complainant and his father.
D.

At the instance of the petitioner, two persons

impersonated the complainant and his father before the socalled arbitrator and gave the statement that they are ready to
hand over the possession of the house as also Rs.30 lacs to the
petitioner.
E.

Thereafter,

petitioner

submitted

another

two

fabricated documents namely 'special power of attorney' before
the so-called arbitrator.

These documents were undated
Page 3 of 10

documents and purported to have been executed by the
complainant and his father in favour of one Pawan Kumar.
These documents records that the complainant and his father
had authorized Pawan Kumar to attend arbitration and court
proceedings at Bihar Sharif, Bihar and to furnish documents,
give statement, receive summons etc.
F.

On the basis of aforenoted documents, petitioner

obtained an award in his favour from the so-called arbitrator.
G.

A vakalatnama was thereafter fabricated by the

petitioner. The said vakalatnama is shown to have been
executed by the complainant and his father on 15.12.1992
appointing one Sh. Sunil Kumar Sinha as their counsel.
said

vakalatnama

also

contained

forged

signatures

The
of

complainant and his father.
H.

On 15.12.1992, petitioner filed an application along

with the affidavit of the arbitrator before the Civil Judge, Bihar
Sharif, Bihar interalia praying that award of the arbitrator be
made rule of the court and passing of the decree in the favour
of petitioner.
I.

Noting the aforenoted fabricated documents, on

12.2.1993, civil court passed a consent decree against the
complainant and his father whereby they were asked to pay
Page 4 of 10

Rs.30 lacs with 18% interest and also hand over possession of
house bearing No. H-229, Jeewan Niketan, Paschim Vihar, New
Delhi.
J.

On 23.7.93, said decree was transferred to court at

Delhi for execution and for issue of warrant of attachment.
K.

Complainant came to know about said decree and

offences

of

fraud,

cheating,

forgery

and

impersonation

committed by the petitioner only in August 1994 when warrant
of attachment was passed by the court at Delhi.
L.

Thereafter, complainant filed the present complaint

against the petitioner, wife and father of the petitioner. He also
filed an application in the court at Bihar Sharif, Bihar for setting
aside said consent decree. The application of the complainant
has been registered as M-60/1994 and court after issuing notice
has ordered an inquiry as to whether any forgery has been
committed by the petitioner.
5.

On the basis of complaint, FIR No.16/99 was

registered against the petitioner and his wife. Charge sheet was
filed under Sections 419,420,467,468,471 and 120 B IPC.
6.

An application was filed by the petitioner before

learned ACMM seeking discharge. Reasons stated for the
discharge were that since the basis of the complaint is that the
Page 5 of 10

petitioner has obtained the consent decree dated 12.2.93 from
the civil court, Bihar Sharif by impersonation, forgery of
documents and thereby committing fraud upon the court of
Civil Judge,Bihar Sharif, Bihar, the learned ACMM, Delhi cannot
take cognizance of the complaint in view of the bar contained
under Section 195(1)(b)(ii), CrPC 1973. That in view of Section
195(1)(b)(ii) read with Section 340, CrPC, 1973, no court other
than the court of Civil Judge, Bihar Sharif has the jurisdiction to
take cognizance of the complaint. That court of Civil Judge,
Bihar Sharif by ordering an inquiry for investigation of
commission of said offences has complied with provisions of
Section and thus had already taken cognizance of the matter.
7.

Noting that the forgery of the documents was

committed before the documents were produced in the court
and law laid down by the Supreme Court in Sachidanand Singh
& Anr. v State of Bihar & Anr., 1998 CrLJ 1565, vide order dated
20.12.02 learned ACMM dismissed the application of the
petitioner.
8.

Thereafter, another application was filed by the

petitioner before learned ACMM for recall of order dated
20.12.02. Vide order dated 17.1.03, learned ACMM dismissed
the said application of the petitioner.

Sub-section

(1)

of

Section

195

Cr.P.C.,

which

according to the petitioner, creates a bar in taking cognizance
on the complaint filed by the complainant, reads as under :
“195. Prosecution for contempt of lawful
authority of public servants, for offences
against public justice and for offences relating
to documents given in evidence. - (1) No Court
shall take cognizance(a)

(i) of any offence punishable under Sections
172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the Indian
Penal Code (45 of 1860), or
(ii) of any abetment of, or attempt to
commit, such offence, or
(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit
such offence,

except on the complaint in writing of the public
servant concerned or of some other public servant to
whom he is administratively subordinate ;
(b) (i) of any offence punishable under any of the following
sections of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), namely,
Sections 193 to 196 (both inclusive), 199, 200, 205 to 211
(both inclusive) and 228, when such offence is alleged to
have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in
any Court, or
(ii) of any offence described in Section 463, or punishable
under Section 471, Section 475 or Section 476, of the said
Code, when such offence is alleged to have been committed
in respect of a document produced or given in evidence in a
proceeding in any Court, or
(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit, or attempt to
commit, or the abetment of, any offence specified in subclause (i) or sub-clause (ii),

Page 7 of 10

except on the complaint in writing of that Court, or of some
other Court to which that Court is subordinate.”
10.

It is not in dispute that alleged forgery of the

documents

was

committed

before

the

documents

were

produced in the Court of Civil Judge, Bihar Sharif, Bihar.
11.

The

principal

controversy

revolves

round

the

interpretation of the expression "when such offence is alleged
to have been committed in respect of a document produced or
given in evidence in a proceeding in any Court" occurring in
clause (b)(ii) of sub-section (1) of Section 195 Cr.P.C.
12.

This issue was considered by the Supreme Court in

the decisions reported as Surjit Singh vs. Balbir Singh 1996 (3)
SCC 533 and Sachida Nand Singh vs. State of Bihar 1998 (2)
SCC 493.
13.

In Surjit Singh's case (supra) it was held that once

the document is given in evidence in Court, the taking of
cognizance on the basis of private complaint is completely
barred.
14.

In Sachida Nand's case (supra) it was held that bar

contained in Section 195 (1)(b)(ii) of the Code is not applicable
to a case where forgery of the document was committed before
the document was produced in a Court.
Page 8 of 10

15.

In view of conflict of opinion between afore-noted 2

decisions of Supreme Court regarding interpretation of Section
195 (1)(b)(ii) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, a 5 Judge
Bench in the decision reported as Iqbal Singh Marwah and Anr.
vs. Meenakshi Marwah & Anr. 2005 III AD (SC) 489 examined
the question in order to end the controversy.
16.

In Iqbal Singh's case (supra) after analysis of the

relevant provisions and noticing a number of earlier decisions,
the Supreme Court recorded its conclusion in paragraph 25
which is being reproduced below:“25. In view of the discussion made above, we are of
the opinion that Sachida Nand Singh has been
correctly decided and the view taken therein is the
correct view. Section 195(1)(b)(ii) Cr.P.C. would be
attracted only when the offences enumerated in the
said provision have been committed with respect to a
document after it has been produced or given in
evidence in a proceeding in any Court i.e. during the
time when the document was in custodia legis.”

17.

Thus it is no longer res integra that the bar

contained in Section 195(1)(b)(ii) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1973 would not apply where forgery of a document
was committed before the said document was produced in
Court.
18.

In the instant case, the alleged forged document

Page 9 of 10

were produced in the Court of Civil Judge subsequently. It is
nobody's case that any offence was as enumerated in Section
195(1)(b)(ii) in respect to said forged documents after it has
been produced or filed in the Court of Civil Judge. Therefore,
the bar created by Section 195 (1)(b)(ii) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1973 would not come into play and there is no
embargo on the power of the learned ACMM to take cognizance
of the offence on the basis of the complaint filed by the
complainant. The view taken by the learned ACMM is perfectly
correct and calls for no interference.
19.

Petition is accordingly dismissed.

20.

No costs.
