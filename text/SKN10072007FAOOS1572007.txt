SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1. The respondent, Mr. Satya Sheel had filed a suit for perpetual
injunction in respect of 9 biswas of land located in revenue
estate of village Sultanpur, Tehsil Haus Khas, New Delhi. The
suit was filed against Mr. Ashwani Agnimitra, who it is admitted
in the plaint was owner of land adjacent to the land owned by
the respondent. The land made subject matter of the suit and

FAO(OS) No. 157/2007

Page 2

the dispute is a passage or 'raasta'.
2. The suit was filed on 5th May, 2003 and written statement to
the said suit was filed by Mr. Ashwani Agnimitra on 4th August,
2003 to which a replication was filed on 30th April, 2004. A
local commissioner was also appointed by the Court and his
report is on record.

The documents stand filed by both the

respondent and Mr. Ashwani Agnimitra.
3. The suit was fixed for framing of issues and arguments on
interim application before the learned Single Judge on 5th May,
2006. On the said date, request for adjournment was made on
the ground that there was change in the counsel for the
defendant Mr. Ashwani Agnimitra. The matter was adjourned to
2nd August, 2006 for arguments on the interim application and
framing of issues.
4. Order dated 2nd August, 2006 passed by the learned Single
Judge records that no one was present on behalf of Mr.
Ashwani

Agnimitra

and

accordingly

the

defendant

was

proceeded ex parte. The respondent herein being the plaintiff
was required to file evidence by way of affidavit.
5. The appellant herein Ms. Raseel G. Ansal thereafter on 5th
December, 2006 filed two applications before the learned
Single Judge being IA No. 13573/2006 for being impleaded as

FAO(OS) No. 157/2007

Page 3

a party to the suit under Order I, Rule 10 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the Code) and IA
No. 13572/2006 under Order IX, Rule 7 of Code for recalling
and setting aside of the ex parte order dated 2nd August, 2006.
The first application being IA No. 13573/2006 though filed
under Order I, Rule 10 of the Code was treated as one under
Order XXII, Rule 10 of the Code and stands allowed vide order
dated 17th April, 2007. By the same order IA No. 13572/2006
under Order IX, Rule 7 of the Code stands dismissed by the
learned Single Judge and this order is made subject matter of
the present appeal.
6. The

appellant

claims

to

have

purchased

property/land

belonging to Mr. Ashwani Agnimitra vide sale deed dated 28th
November, 2005, which was registered with the Sub-Registrar
on 14th February, 2006. It was stated in the application for
setting aside of the ex parte order dated 2nd August, 2006 that
the change in the counsel had taken place pursuant to
execution of the sale deed. It was also stated that there were
talks of amicable settlement on the subject matter of the suit
between the appellant and the respondent. This it is submitted
was the reason for some delay in moving the application for
impleadment and the application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the

FAO(OS) No. 157/2007

Page 4

Code for recalling the ex parte order dated 2nd August, 2006.
In paragraph 8 of the application for recalling of the ex parte
order dated 2nd August, 2006, it is mentioned that on the said
date, the suit was directed to be listed on 6th November, 2006
and the said date was noted by the new counsel and intimated
to the appellant but in the order sheet it was recorded that the
matter would be listed on 6th September, 2006. In this regard
counsel for the appellant had drawn our attention to the cause
list dated 6th November, 2006 in which the suit in question was
also shown but as per note was deleted. We need not enter
into this controversy.

However, both the parties, i.e. the

appellant and the respondent, admit that on 2nd August, 2006
Mr. Arunabh Choudhary, Advocate had appeared before the
learned Single Judge and had asked for time for filing of
vakalatnama though his presence and request is not recorded
in the order.

In the reply filed by the respondent to the

application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the Code, the respondent
has admitted that the order dated 2nd August, 2006 was
passed in the presence of the counsel for the appellant. It may
be relevant to state here that the appellant had also executed
power of attorney/vakalatnama dated 18th May, 2006, which
was filed in the Court on 23rd August, 2006.

FAO(OS) No. 157/2007

7. Under Order IX, Rule 7 of the Code, on good cause being
shown for previous non-appearance, an ex parte order can be
recalled or set aside. The said provision is a part of procedural
law and is designed to do substantial justice.

The said

provision is not on penal enactment for punishing parties. Laws
of procedure are meant to effectively regulate, assist and aid
the object of doing substantial justice and not to take away the
right to properly and effectively defend proceedings. At the
same time, courts have to be cautious on not extending an
helping hand to an erring party, which seeks to deliberately and
intentionally delay proceedings.

Unscrupulous parties cannot

be allowed to take advantage of misplaced sympathy and thus
perpetuate injustice. A balance has to be struck.This aspect
has been highlighted in two judgments of this Court in Ram Lal
Kathuria versus Shiv Kumar Sharma [82 (1999) DLT 464]
and Subhash Kumar versus Delhi Development Authority,
[1999 II AD (Delhi) 817].

In the case of Ram Lal Kathuria

(supra), the applicant therein had earlier filed a writ petition,
which was rejected. Review application filed in the said writ
petition was also dismissed.

The applicant thereafter filed

several suits, which too met with the same fate. Thereafter, the
contesting party filed a suit claiming possession and mesne

FAO(OS) No. 157/2007

Page 6

profits in which the applicant therein was served but failed to
appear and an application for setting aside of the ex parte order
was filed after nearly 10 months and the same was rejected.
This Court specifically noticed the past conduct of the applicant
therein and history of previous litigation between the parties. It
was noticed that the stand taken by the applicant therein about
his advocate being seriously ill and not in the country was
incorrect. Similarly, in the case of Subhash Kumar (supra), the
order records the applicant therein had deliberately absented
himself on several dates when the case was fixed for trial and
did

not

cross-examine

witnesses

in

spite

of

repeated

opportunities. The application for setting aside of the ex parte
order dated 4th July, 1994 was filed only on 25th March, 1996.
Paragraph 3 of the said order reveals that the counsel for the
applicant had made a statement on 14th September, 1994 that
she would be moving an application for setting aside of the ex
parte order but the said application was moved after substantial
delay only on 25th March, 1996. In these circumstances, the
court held that the applicant had deliberately and intentionally
sought to delay and prolong the proceedings and showing any
indulgence would not subserve the interest of justice and equity
and, therefore, refused to set the clock back.

These cases

FAO(OS) No. 157/2007

Page 7

have to be distinguished from cases where defaults are made
by the parties or their counsel due to lack of knowledge and
understanding of law and procedure and other mistakes and
errors. To err is human and when just cause is shown, the
same can be condoned but an attempt to stall and delay
proceedings deliberately and consciously has to be dealt with
differently.

These cases cannot be equated with mala fide

defaults made with ulterior motives to prolong the proceedings
and delay the final outcome.
8. The present case in our opinion falls in the category wherein
the appellant has committed default in failing to file power of
attorney on or before 2nd August, 2006. However, we find that
before the said date the appellant had already executed the
power of attorney on 18th May, 2006. Strangely this
power of attorney on behalf of the appellant was not filed,
though counsel was appearing in the Court and getting
instructions from the appellant. Learned counsel for the
appellant could not have filed power of attorney on behalf of
Mr. Ashwani Agnimitra, who had sold his property to the
appellant.

There was delay in filing of the application for

impleadment on behalf of the appellant. The application was
filed under the wrong provision i.e., Order I, Rule 10 of the
Code and not under the provisions of Order XXII, Rule 10 of the
Code.

Perhaps the counsel for the appellant was not fully

aware of the relevant statutory provisions and steps to be
taken. The said applications were filed on 5th December, 2006

FAO(OS) No. 157/2007

Page 8

within about four months of the order dated 2nd August, 2006,
when the appellant was proceeded ex parte. The appellant has
sought to explain the delay the proceedings by stating that
there were talks of settlement between the appellant and the
respondent. This fact is denied by the respondent and, cannot
be resolved and decided without evidence. We also find that
the order sheet reveals that Mr. Ashwani Agnimitra was
regularly appearing in the suit and contesting the same.
Written statement to the suit was filed immediately after service
on 4th August, 2003 and in fact the respondent thereafter took
considerable time to file replication, which was filed on 30th
April, 2004. The counsel for the appellant started appearing in
the matter after the sale deed was registered on 14th February,
2006 as a counsel for Mr. Ashwani Agnimitra and his presence
is recorded on 24th March, 2006, when statement of counsel
for both the parties were recorded by the Joint Registrar that
they do not wish to carry out admission and denial of
documents. The counsel for the appellant also appeared for
and on behalf of Mr. Ashwani Agnimitra on 5th May, 2006 and
2nd August, 2006. It is also admitted by the counsel for the
respondent that on 2nd August, 2006 counsel for the appellant
was present in the Court but his presence was not recorded as
vakalatnama was not on record.

Keeping these aspects in

mind, we feel that substantial justice will be done by directing
the appellant to pay cost of Rs.50,000/- to the respondent for
the default on her part in failing to file vakalatnama on or before
2nd August, 2006 and thereafter causing delay of about four
months in moving application for substitution and setting aside
order dated 2nd August, 2006. It may be relevant to state here

FAO(OS) No. 157/2007

Page 9

that after the order dated 2nd August, 2006 was passed,
nothing substantial has transpired except that the respondent
has filed affidavit by way of evidence. Lapse and default on the
part of the appellant cannot be termed as mala fide or
deliberate. The appellant had nothing to gain, having purchased
the property for consideration.
9. It may be noticed here that the appellant was required to file an
application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act for the delay in
moving the application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the Code and
no such application was filed. However, we are not inclined to
dismiss the appeal on this ground alone.

We find that

necessary averments and facts explaining the delay in moving
the application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the Code have been
mentioned in IA No. 13572/2006. It may also be noticed that
the application under Order I, Rule 10 of the Code (treated as
one under Order XXII, Rule 10 of the Code) for substituting the
appellant in place of

the

original

defendant

was

also

allowed vide order dated 17th April, 2007,i.e. the impugned
order by which application under Order IX, Rule 7 of the Code
was

dismissed. Thus, the appellant became a party w.e.f.

17th

April, 2007.

10.In view of the above, we allow the present appeal and set aside
the order dated 17th April, 2007 dismissing IA No. 13572/2006,
subject to payment of cost of Rs.50,000/- by the appellant to

FAO(OS) No. 157/2007

Page 10

the respondent within a period of three weeks from today. The
matter will be listed before the learned Single Judge for framing
of issues on 6th August, 2007. The appellant will be given only
one opportunity to file affidavit by way of evidence.

The

appellant will also not seek any adjournment to cross-examine
the witnesses of the respondent. Subject to payment of cost of
Rs.50,000/- within three weeks and with the above directions,
we set aside the ex parte order dated 2nd August, 2006 and
allow the present appeal.
