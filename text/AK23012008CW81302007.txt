ANIL KUMAR, J. (Oral)

1.

The petitioner has impugned the order dated 13th September,

2007 of the Labour Court in LCA No.3/2007 dismissing the petition
filed by the petitioner under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 being not maintainable.
2.

The petitioner claimed that he was employed as a Computer

Assistant with the Management since 1st July, 1984 on the initial
salary of Rs.1.180/- per month and in 1999, the Management had
implemented the Fifth Pay Commission with effect from 1st January,
1996 with some modifications and accordingly the pay of the cadre of
WP(C) No.8130/2007

Page 1 of 5

Administrative Staff was fixed in the basic pay of Rs.5,000/-, however,
the Management with ulterior motive fixed the pay of the workman in
the basic pay of Rs.4,200/- instead of Rs.5,000/- and the arrears
have been paid according to the basic pay of Rs.4,200/- and not
according to the pay of Rs.5,000/-.
3.

The petitioner, therefore, filed a petition seeking striking down

the decrease in salary from Rs.5,000/- to Rs.4,200/- and claimed his
full back wages with

continuous seniority and for revision of pay

scale and payment of arrears with interest at 18% per annum.
4.

The petition was contested by the respondents contending that

the petition is not maintainable as there is no pre-existing right
already adjudicated upon or provided under any settlement or award
or under any statute and consequently the petition claiming fixation
of the salary at Rs.5,000/- and payment of arrears on the basis of
basic salary of Rs.5,000/- and reinstatement is not maintainable.
5.

The Management/respondent also denied the claim to pay the

amount on account of delay and laches and on account of the fact
that a complaint has been filed against the petitioner for accepting
Rs.1,50,000/- as bribe for securing the admission. It is alleged that
the petitioner was arrested in the case of accepting bribe and
remained in police custody till 22nd August, 2005. According to the
respondents, the petitioner is in the category of Administrative Staff
WP(C) No.8130/2007

and, therefore, he is entitled for a pay scale of Rs.4,200/- only.
6.

It is no more res integra that the question of arrears of back

wages or the pay scale can be decided only in a proceeding pursuant
to a reference under Section 10 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
and under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 the
Industrial Tribunal cannot arrogate the function to itself. The Labour
Court also does not have jurisdiction to first decide the workman's
entitlement and thereafter to proceed to compute the benefit so
adjudicated on that basis in exercise of its power under

Section

33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
7.

This also cannot be disputed that to invoke the jurisdiction of

the Labour Court under

Section 33(C)(2), first there must be

entitlement of the workman to receive from the employer any money
or benefit which is capable of being computed and that question must
have arisen as to the amount of money due or as to the rate or criteria
at which such benefit should be computed.
8.

The Labour Court has relied on Jeet Lal Sharma Vs Presiding

Officer, Labour Court IVth and another [2000 (85) FLR 268]; MCD Vs.
Ganesh Razak and Another, 1995 – 1 L.L.N.S.C. 402; State of U.P.
Vs. Brijpal Singh, 2005 VIII AD (SC) 250; Municipal Corporation of
Delhi vs. Raghunath Rath & others [2003 (99) FLR 144] Delhi;
Jagannath Bhagwandas Shrivastav and Others Vs. Harish Thadani
WP(C) No.8130/2007

and Another, 1993 L 48 LC.2508; Bombay and Basant Lal Vs.
Management of M/s.A.F. Ferguson & Co. & Anr., 2002 LLR 612
(Delhi) and has come to the conclusion that computation of the
amount claimed by the claimant, i.e., whether the arrears has to be
paid at Rs.5,000/- or Rs.4,200/-has not been settled by an Industrial
Tribunal and this fact cannot be adjudicated under Section 33(C)(2).
The finding of the Labour Court that without adjudicating the
entitlement of the petitioner to get the arrears at the basic salary of
Rs.5,000/-, the arrears claimed by the petitioner cannot be claimed
under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 does not
suffer from any apparent error. The Labour court has also held that
claim of the petitioner for striking down the decrease in salary and
status and reinstatement of workman in his post and continuous
seniority and full back wages also cannot be determined in exercise of
powers under Section 33(C)(2) of the Act.

The petition of the

petitioner was not entertained by the Labour Court on account of
delay and latches as the report of the Fifth Pay Commission was
implemented with effect from 1st January, 1996 in the year 1999
whereas the petition under Section 33(C)(2) has been filed on 3rd
February, 2002 without a plausible explanation. Learned counsel for
the petitioner has relied on 18(1980) DLT 460, D.P. Maheshwari Vs.
Delhi Administration & Others holding that non-reference to the
evidence of an important witness while dismissing the point in issue

WP(C) No.8130/2007

Page 4 of 5

would clearly vitiate the order of the Labour Court. Apparently, the
judgment relied on by the petitioner is clearly distinguishable. In the
case relied on by the petitioner, the Court was concerned with an
award holding that the appellant was a workman pursuant to a
reference made under Section 10(1)(C) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 in contra-distinction to the petitioner's petition under Section
33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Learned counsel for the
petitioner is unable to show any precedent laying down that the
entitlement of the petitioner whether his basic salary should be
Rs.4,200/- or Rs.5,000/- and whether he is liable to be reinstated
and paid the arrears of the salary, can be adjudicated without
reference under Section 10(1)(C) and in a petition under Section
33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.
9.

In the circumstances, there is no manifest error or perversity or

apparent error or denial of principle of natural justice so as to entail
interference by this Court in exercise of its powers under Article 226
of the Constitution of India against the order dated 13th September,
2007 passed by the Labour Court No.XII in LCA No.3/2007.
10.

The writ petition is without any merit and is, therefore,

dismissed. Parties are however, left to bear their own costs.
