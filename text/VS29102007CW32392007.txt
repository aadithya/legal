:
1.
The Union of India impugns the order passed by the
Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (for
short 'the Tribunal') passed in O.A.No.659/2006, filed by the
respondent, whereby the Tribunal allowed his Original Application
filed under Section 19 of the Administrative Tribunal Act . The
Tribunal, inter-alia, directed the petitioner herein to refix the pay

of the respondent by reckoning the increments earned by him
while working with temporary status, within a period of two
months.
2.

The respondent was initially appointed as a casual

worker in April 1990.
10.11.1997.

He was granted temporary status on

He was thereafter appointed to a regular post of

Peon with effect from 22.8.2005 vide order dated 1.9.2005.
During the period

that he was holding temporary status, the

respondent earned yearly increments in the pay scale of Rs.750940

(pre-revised)

w.e.f.

10.11.1997.

However

when

the

respondent was regularised in service, the petitioner sought to fix
his pay at the minimum stage of the pay scale of Rs.2,550-3200
i.e. at Rs.2,550/- per month w.e.f. 22.8.2005 thereby taking away
the annual increments earned by the respondent over a period of
eight years in temporary capacity.

This was challenged by the

respondent before the Tribunal in the aforesaid O.A.
3.

The

Tribunal

relying

on

its

earlier

decisions

in

M.K.Rajan & Ors, V. Union of India in O.A. 606/2001 decided
on 12.10.2001, in respect of which the special leave petition,
being SLP (Civil No.11667/02) was dismissed on 4.8.2003, &
Nathu Singh & Ors. V. Union of India & Ors, 2002(1) ATJ8
and Giriraj Sharma v. UOI & Ors, O.A. No.65 of 2005, decided
W.P. (C) No. 3239/2007

Page No. 2 of 3

on 2.9.2005 allowed the aforesaid O.A.
4.

Our attention has been drawn to two orders of this Court in

W.P(C)11884/2005, UOI v. Kailash Chand & Ors., and in W.P.
(C) No.2317/2002, UOI v. Nathu Singh & Ors. whereby similar
writ petitions filed by the UOI have been dismissed by this Court.
While dismissing the writ petitions, the Division Bench of this
Court took note of the fact that the Kerala High Court had taken a
similar view as taken by the Tribunal in those cases, and the
Supreme Court had also dismissed the special leave petition
against the judgment of the Kerala High Court.

In fact the

judgment of the Kerala High Court has even been implemented.
5.

Following the aforesaid decisions of this Court, we find no

merit in this petition and dismiss the same.
