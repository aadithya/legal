PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys

transaction

had

with Polar

Industries Ltd. It is also not in dispute that between 10.1.1996
and

27.1.1996

Rs.18,22,654/-.

various

invoices

were

raised

totalling

As per Polar Industries Ltd. the invoices were

cleared

for

payment

by

Polar

Industries

Ltd.

in

sum

of

Rs.18,03,244/-.
2.

According to M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys Ltd. amount

payable is as per invoices raised i.e. Rs.18,22,654/-.
3.

On 24.2.1996, 18.3.1996 and 20.3.1996, 3 cheques

were admittedly issued by Polar Industries to M/s.Ruchi Strips &
Alloys

Ltd.

in

sum

of

Rs.5,42,100/-,

Rs.3,41,629/-

and

Rs.3,22,661/- towards part payment of the amount payable under
the invoices.
4.

It

is

not

in

dispute

that

when

presented

for

encashment, all 3 cheques were returned dishonoured by the
banker of Polar Industries.
5.

3 complaints were filed under Section 138/141 of the

Negotiable Instruments Act 1881. Each pertaining to one cheque
issued by Polar Industries.
6.

Pertaining to the complaint which related to the

cheque in sum of Rs.3,41,629/- being Complaint No.1440/1996 an
order came to be passed on 27.1.2000 by the M.M. recording that
pursuant to a compromise between the parties 5 cheques issued
by Polar Industries in favour of M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys Ltd. being
encashed, M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys Ltd. was agreeable for
withdrawal of the case.
7.

Thus, Complaint Case No.1440/1996 was disposed of

as settled between the parties.

8.

Pertaining to the two other complaints relating to the

cheque in sum of Rs.5,42,100/- and Rs.3,22,661/-, Polar Industries
started asserting that an all embracing settlement has been
arrived at between the parties. That to clear liability in sum of
Rs.18,03,244/-, being the value of the invoices as admitted to be
payable by Polar Industries, M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys Ltd. had
issued 11 cheques detailed as under:Cheque No.

Ltd. was thus bound to withdraw the complaints pertaining to
cheque in sum of

Rs.5,42,100/-

as also

cheque in sum of

Rs.3,22,661/-. According to the petitioner since M/s.Ruchi Strips
& Alloys Ltd. did not agree to withdraw the said two complaints,
only remedy available was to seek quashing of the said 2
complaints for the reason civil dispute pertaining to the cheques
being settled, the complaints could not be proceeded ahead.
10.

Question which arises for consideration is, whether by

receiving the 11 cheques noted in para 8 above, M/s.Ruchi Strips
& Alloys Ltd. consented to a settlement of all claims pertaining to

the 3 cheques issued by Polar Industries in sum of Rs.3,41,629/-,
Rs.5,42,100/- and Rs.3,22,661/-.
11.

Admittedly, there is no written document evidencing

the settlement if any between the parties.
12.

It is urged by learned counsel for the petitioners that

the value of the 11 cheques noted in para 8 above equals to the
liability admitted by the petitioner pursuant to the 6 invoices
raised on it by M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys Ltd. and thus, there exists
sufficient evidence where from it can be safely inferred that by
receiving the 11 cheques and on encashment of the 11 cheques
an all embracing settlement between the parties was not only
arrived at but even satisfied.
13.

Per contra, learned counsel for M/s.Ruchi Strips &

Alloys Ltd.

submits

that as per the invoices,

on

delayed

payment, M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys Ltd. was entitled to interest
@24% per annum.

Learned counsel submits that out of 11

cheques (detailed in para 8 above) received by M/s.Ruchi Strips &
Alloys Ltd., 5 cheques in sum of Rs.1,19,370/- each were received
for satisfaction of cheque in sum of Rs.3,41,629/- for the reason
interest had accrued in the interregnum.
14.

Learned counsel for the respondent further points out

that order dated 27.1.2000 passed by the learned Metropolitan
Magistrate pertaining to Complaint Case No.1440/1996 relatable
to the cheque in sum of Rs.3,41,629/- clearly records that on the

last date 5 cheques were received by M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys
Ltd. for satisfaction of the claim pertaining to the cheque in sum
of Rs.3,41,629/-. Thus, learned counsel for the respondent urges
that prima facie the 5 cheques in sum of Rs.1,19,370/- each would
relate to satisfaction of the cheque in sum of Rs.3,41,629/-.
15.

Learned counsel for the respondent further points out

that earlier on, petitioner had filed a petition under Section 482 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure wherein it was averred that the
respondent had not even disclosed to Polar Industries pendency
of 2 other complaints and by suppressing the factum of
institution

and

pendency

of

the

complaints

had

received

payments from Polar Industries which relate to the dishonoured
cheques which were subject matter of the 2 other complaints.
Counsel points out that in the instant petitions a different stand
has been taken. It is pointed out that in the instant petitions what
is pleaded is that the settlement between the parties was a
comprehensive settlement relating to all 3 complaints.
16.

I am not to weigh the evidenciary value of the

respective stands taken for the reason this would be a task which
would be required to be performed by the learned Trial Judge.
17.

Suffice would it be to state that where a disputed

question of fact arises between the parties and the said disputed
questions of fact requires evidence to be led, it would be
impermissible for this Court to quash the complaint exercising its

power under Section 482 of the Code of Civil Procedure.
18.

I have noted herein above the rival versions of the

parties. The rival versions of the parties cannot be adjudicated
without recording further evidence.
19.

Whereas Polar Industries relies very heavily on the fact

that the value of the 11 cheques (detailed in para 8 above) is
Rs.18,03,244/- equivalent to the value of the invoices as passed
by it and therefore seeks to urge that this evidences

an all

comprehensive settlement; M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys Ltd. asserts
that the invoices were raised in the year 1996.

For delayed

payments, interest @24% per annum was payable.

M/s.Ruchi

Strips & Alloys Ltd. further asserts that as recorded in the order
dated 27.1.2000, satisfaction of the claim pertaining to the
cheque in sum of Rs.3,41,620/- was

by means of 5 cheques.

M/s.Ruchi Strips & Alloys Ltd. asserts that the 5 cheques were the
ones issued in sum of Rs.1,19,370/20.

I thus find no merits in the petitions.

21.

I clarify that nothing stated in the present order would

be construed as an expression on the merits of the controversy
for the reason I have consciously eschewed to discuss the
evidenciary value of the rival versions.

I have only highlighted

the rival versions of the parties and the fact that the resolution of
the same would require evidence to be led.
22.

No costs.
