5.

DIG/NEZ,

Calcutta

being

the

superior

authority to the disciplinary authority suo moto
reviewed the case and found that the quantum of
punishment awarded by the disciplinary authority to
the petitioner is not commensurate with the gravity
of the misconduct of moral turpitude proved against
cwp14193-2006

Page 5 of 17

him

and,

therefore,

needs

to

be

enhanced.

The

DIG/NEZ in exercise of his powers conferred upon
him under Rule 29(A) Schedule-II of CISF Rules read
with

Rule

49(2)

enhanced

the

punishment

from

reduction of pay to dismissal from service. The
said order of the reviewing authority is Annexure
P-2 to the present petition. The relevant portion
of

the

order

of

the

reviewing

authority

is

reproduced herein below:“5. I
have
gone
through
the
records. The lady Smt.Roy has
very clearly stated that she had
been once offered Haryana the
delinquent for a cinema. She had
snubbed him. Again next day he
wanted to forcibly take her to a
cinema and a lunch. He dragged
her and when she shouted for
help, she was able to release
herself from his clutches and
escape in the confines of her
flat. Her statement is quite
clear and complete. Her conduct
is not telling the neighbours
after the incident and wait for
her husband to return looks quite
natural. Since she had shouted
for help and fearing that public
cwp14193-2006

Page 6 of 17

will gather or labourers working
nearby
will
gather,
the
delinquent had probably loosened
his grip and thus even before the
neighbours could gather or came
to
her
rescue,
due
to
his
released grip, the lady was able
to get away from his clutches and
escape to her room. Since she was
able to go back to her room even
before help could came, it was
quite natural for her to keep
herself closed in the room and
wait for her husband, rather than
open the room, come out of it and
start narrating the incident to
every one and create a more
unpleasant scene for herself. Her
conduct
has
been
absolutely
natural and the plea of the
delinquent has no weight.
6.His plea that no man can
forcibly drag a woman to a
public place for cinema, looks
correct as no man can keep
dragged
a
woman
on
roads,
cinemahalls and restaurants and
make her see film and eat food
in restaurants while he keeps
dragging
her.
Obviously
the
delinquent knews it is not
possible. But his misconduct
has been that he dragged her
from her room out of it to
force her to go with him. This
is certainly possible and the
delinquent appears to have done
cwp14193-2006

Page 7 of 17

it. The statement of the lady
Smt.Roy is sufficient to prove
it.
7.I consider the statement of
Smt.Roy Completely truthful and
natural. Her conduct has also
been
absolutely
natural.
Obviously there would not have
been any public witnesses to
this incident, so otherwise the
delinquent would not have dared
to do so.
8.The
lady
Smt.Roy
has
only
recently
joined
with
her
husband. She had obviously no
ill motive about the delinquent
to lodge a false complaint
against
him.
Unless
the
incident
had
occurred,
as
narrated
by
her,
that
the
delinquent tried to outrage her
modesty, she would not have
reported it. No Indian women
will do it, unless she had
suffered so such, that she can
not bear it any more and feels
her tormentor will continues to
do so. Since she knew that
unless the matter is reported,
the delinquent is not going to
restrain
himself,
she
had
lodged the complaint.
9.Since presence of such persons
in Force whose presence can
make the life of families and
women unsafe, I believe they
are not fit to be retained with
cwp14193-2006

Page 8 of 17

uniformed force. If delinquent
had no respect for the wife of
a colleague, the modesty of any
other woman around, was not
safe. Such persons bring bad
name to the Force and people
lose faith in Khaki uniform.
This can not be allowed and has
to be dealt with sternly. He
does
not
deserve
sympathy.
Therefore,
in
exercise
of
powers conferred upon me under
Rule 29(A) Schedule-II of CISF
Rules read with Rule 49(2). I
hereby
award
the
enhanced
penalty
of
“DISMISSAL
FROM
SERVICES” upon No. 874380295
Constable Balwinder Kumar of
CISF 2nd Res. Block No. 13, CGO
Complex, Delhi with immediate
effect.”
6.

The

reviewing

authority

while

enhancing

the punishment as stated above, gave liberty to the
petitioner to file an appeal against his order to
the appellate authority, if he so desires, within
thirty days of the receipt of the review order.
Aggrieved, by the aforesaid order of the reviewing
authority, the petitioner preferred an appeal to
the

Director-General

of

Police

and

as

Pursuant

to

directions of this Court, the appellate authority
vide its order dated 21.6.2006 dismissed the appeal
of the petitioner against the order dated 13.5.1998
of

the

authority.

The

order

of

the

appellate authority is Annexure P-1 at Pages 23 to
29 of the paper book. Aggrieved by the dismissal of

appeal

by

authority,

the

petitioner has preferred this appeal and has prayed
for

certiorari

quashing

the

impugned

order dated 13.5.1998 and also the order of the
appellate
cwp14193-2006

authority

dated

21.6.2006

and

for

7.

In

response

to

notice

of

this

writ

petition, the respondents have filed their counter
affidavit and have justified the dismissal of the
petitioner

from

service

in

view

of

charge

of

misconduct involving moral turpitude proved against
him. The respondents have prayed for dismissal of
this writ petition.
8.

We have heard the learned counsel for the

parties and have also perused the record.
9.

The learned counsel appearing on behalf of

the petitioner had attacked the impugned orders on
the ground of double jeopardy. It was contended by
him that the petitioner could not have been removed
from service by the reviewing authority once the
disciplinary authority had
reduction

pay

by

two

awarded punishment of
stages

on

the

charges

proved against him. It was also contended that the
cwp14193-2006

Page 11 of 17

petitioner has put an unblemished service for more
than

ten

years

before

he

was

charged

for

the

offence of moral turpitude regarding misbehaviour
with

the

wife

of

his

own

colleague.

During

arguments, the learned counsel did not point out
any

procedural

infirmity

in

the

decision

making

process that led to the dismissal of the petitioner
from

service.

We

have

given

our

careful

consideration to the facts of the case and also the
legal plea of double jeopardy raised on behalf of
the petitioner. In our view, the plea of double
jeopardy
wholly

urged

on

misplaced.

The

have

the

lady

with

whom

the

misbehaviour had taken place were examined and they
all were also cross-examined by the petitioner. The
statement

of

the

petitioner

was

also

recorded

during the enquiry and the charges levelled against
him stood duly proved from the statement of the
lady as well as the statement of the petitioner
himself. It is borne out from the record that the
petitioner

had

admitted

his

mistake

in

his

representation dated 28.6.1997 and had assured the
disciplinary authority not to commit such a mistake
in the future. The reviewing authority as well as
the appellate authority have both taken this aspect
of

the

matter

into

consideration.

The

relevant

portion of the order of the appellate authority on
this aspect is reproduced herein below:“On going through the entire case
file, I find from the evidence
adduced
during
the
course
of
cwp14193-2006

In

the
appellant

grabbed her hand and dragged her
towards the door. Further, from
the deposition of HC/GD G.Ramesh,
CHM(PW-III),
it
has
been
circumstantially established that
the appellant managed night duty
continuously for 09 days in order
to remain present in the daytime
in the absence of lady's husband.
Moreover,
the
appellant
has
admitted his mistake as per his
representation
dated
28.06.97,
submitted
against
the
Enquiry
Report
and
has
assured
the
Disciplinary
Authority
not
to
commit such a mistake in the
future. This proves the guilt and
involvement of the appellant in
the said incident.”

of

We do not find any merit in the contention
the

of

carefully gone through the order of the reviewing

cwp14193-2006

Page 14 of 17

authority

dated

13.5.1998.

The

said

order

was

passed by the reviewing authority in exercise of
its powers under Rule 29(A) Schedule-II of CISF
Rules r/w Rule 49(2). Rule 49(2) of CISF Rules,
1969 is extracted below:“49(2) The revising authority
may remit, vary or enhance the
punishment
imposed,
or
may
order a fresh inquiry or the
taking of further evidence in
the case as it may consider
necessary.”
11.

A plain reading of the above rule would

show that the DIG/NEZ being the superior authority
to the disciplinary authority of the petitioner was
well

within

his

right

to

review

the

case

and

enhance the punishment. The question is, if the
reviewing authority had the power to review the
decision

of

the

disciplinary

authority,

whether

exercise of such power by him can be said to be
vitiated
question
cwp14193-2006

the

Answer

negative.

The

to

this

act

of

Page 15 of 17

misbehaviour committed by the petitioner with the
wife

of

his

own

colleague

constitutes

a

grave

misconduct. Such a misconduct on the part of the
petitioner as member of the disciplined armed force
had

the

effect

of

bringing

a

bad

name

to

the

uniformed force and its gravity gets compounded as
the offence was done by a person in Khaki uniform.
We are of the view that the reviewing authority as
well as the appellate authority were justified in
their view that to

allow such persons like the

petitioner to remain in the uniformed force would
be a stigma to the organisation which is supposed
to act as a protector of life and property.
12.

In view of the above, we do not find any

merit in

this writ petition which fails and

is

hereby dismissed but in the circumstances without
any order as to costs.
