PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Respondent, Hans Raj Miglani, filed a suit for recovery

of Rs.97,946/- against the petitioner. According to the petitioner,
no money was payable to Hans Raj Miglani. Petitioner claimed to
be in possession of a tape recorded conversation in which Hans
Raj Miglani had admitted that he had not to receive any money
from the petitioner.
2.

An application was moved by the petitioner before the

learned Trial Judge under Sections 3, 45 and 146 of the Indian
Evidence Act read with Section 151 CPC praying that Hans Raj

Miglani be directed to get recorded his voice on a blank audio
cassette

so that the petitioner could send the same for an

analysis of a voice expert to prove that the tape recorded
conversation on which the petitioner was relying contained the
voice of the petitioner.
3.

Learned Trial Judge has dismissed the application

holding that there was no provision in law which permitted the
court to direct recording of sample voice of Hans Raj Miglani.
4.

As per decision of the Supreme Court reported as AIR

1975 SC 1788, Z.B.Bukhari Vs. B.R.Mehra, it is a settled legal
position that tape records of speeches are documents as defined
by Section 3 of the Evidence Act. Thus, cassette or tape recording
of the alleged conversation

between Hans Raj Miglani

and an

employee of the petitioner would be a document.
5.

In the report published as AIR 1971 SC 1162, N.Sri

Rama Reddy Vs. V.V.Giri, it was held

that a tape recorded

conversation was a primary and direct evidence

admissible for

what had been said by the speaker and picked up by the receiver.
6.

Under Section 155 of the Evidence Act, credibility of a

witness can be impeached by proof of former statements which
are inconsistent with any part of his evidence and which is liable
to be contradicted.

Thus, the tape recording of a conversation if

contains a former statement which is inconsistent

with current

statement made by a witness would be good evidence to impeach
the credibility of a witness.
7.

Section 45 of the Evidence Act pertains to opinions of

experts. It reads as under :“45. Opinion of Experts.- When the court has to
form an opinion upon a point of foreign law or of
science or art, or as to identity of handwriting
or finger expressions, the opinions upon that
point of persons specially skilled in such foreign
law, science or art, or in questions as to identity
of handwriting or finger expressions are relevant
facts.
8.

Such persons are called experts.”
In the decision reported as AIR 1990 SC 1050, State Vs.

S.J.Choudhary, it was held that with the growth of forensic
science, it was permissible to match the march of forensic science
with an extended

ambit of Section 45 of the Evidence Act.

Opinion upon a point of science or art was held to include an
opinion pertaining to a tape script.
9.

The only issue which needs to be decided is, whether

Hans Raj Miglani can be called upon to give a voice sample.
10.

Before Hans Raj Miglani's credibility can be impeached,

it would have to be established that the document i.e. the tape
contains the conversation in which Hans Raj Miglani has spoken
with the receiver.

Till purity thereof is established, it would be

impossible to contradict current statements

made by Hans Raj

Miglani.
11.

In the report published as (2005) 3 Cal.LT 55, Dwijadas

Banerjee & Ors. Vs. State of West Bengal, it was observed that
the power of comparison either in

writing, or finger prints

or

voice lies with the court, if it is required by the court in any trial
or proceeding for just decision of the case, the court may pass
appropriate orders.
12.

I eschew

the decisions pertaining to criminal trial

where right of silence of the accused was in
denied permission to the prosecution

issue and court

to obtain voice sample

during stage of investigation.
13.

Instant case is for a civil claim praying for a money

decree.
14.

Subject to the statutory safeguards to

be ensured,

namely, no editing, cutting or pasting as also authenticity of the
tape being established, petitioner would be entitled to prove, with
reference to voice sample of Hans Raj Miglani, the contents of the
tape recorded conversation.
15.

The petition stands disposed of quashing the impugned

order dated 31.5.2001. Petitioner's application is allowed.
16.

Learned

Trial

Judge

would

obtain

voice

sample

recording of Hans Raj Miglani and at the expense of the petitioner
would obtain a forensic opinion of the voice expert in respect of
the tape recorded conversation on which the petitioner relies.
17.

No costs.
