of law is involved in all these case.
2.

Brief facts leading to dispute are that the Assessee is

engaged in the business of manufacturing of dairy whitener
and

skimmed

milk

powder.

The

Assessee

claimed

deduction under Section 80-IA of the Income Tax Act, 1961
(for short as „Act‟) from assessment year 1995-96 onwards.
The Assessee‟s claim of deduction was initially not objected
to for the assessment year 1995-96 as no scrutiny
assessment under Section 143(3) of the Act was made and
only processing of the return of income was done under
Section 143(1)(a) of the Act.

During the course of the

assessment proceedings under Section 143(3) of the Act
for assessment year 1996-97, the Assessing Officer asked
the Assessee to justify its claim of deduction under Section
80-IA of the Act. The Assessee submitted that during the
period relevant to assessment year 1995-96 and thereafter
he had set up a new project with the state of art technology
for multiplying the production capacity and enhancing the
product quality.

The new technology was aimed at

improving the productivity, operational efficiency, saving in

ITA No.1552/2006

Page 2 of 11

energy cost and significant improvement in the product
quality. As a result, the output increased substantially and
there was a better product mix with more value added
products. The Assessee stated that for this purpose it had
entered into arrangements for acquiring new technology
know-how as well as plant and machinery from M/s
Rotacom Industries BV, Netherlands and M/s Seppo Ralli
OY, Finland, who were the pioneer in providing technology
for dryer and evaporators, which were main process
equipments in the manufacture of dairy whitener and milk
powder.

As a result, on 31st December, 1994 the

Assessee‟s plant and machinery

was of the value of

Rs.125.74 lacs as against the old plant and machinery of
Rs.20.86 lacs. Thus, old plant and machinery was less than
20% permissible under provisions of Section 80-IA of the
Act.
3.

During the course of assessment proceedings for the

assessment year 1996-97, the Assessee claimed that a new
industrial undertaking has come into existence which has
commenced commercial production from 1st January, 1995.

ITA No.1552/2006

Page 3 of 11

4.

The Assessing Officer held that the Assessee was

engaged in the production of dairy whitener and milk
powder. Prior to 1st January, 1995 also the Assessee was
manufacturing the same products.

All that the Assessee

had done was to undertake a modernization-cum-expansion
programme of the existing undertaking.
Assessing

Officer

relied

Directors‟ report for the year 1993-94. It was further held
by the Assessing Officer that no separate and independent
industrial unit came into existence and it was only
absorption of the old business and so-called new industrial
undertaking was nothing but modernization of the existing
unit and as such the Assessee‟s case was hit by the
provisions of Section 80-IA(2)(i) of the Act. The Assessing
Officer, therefore, disallowed the claim of the Assessee
under Section 80IA of the Act.
5.

Against the assessment order, the Assessee filed

appeals before the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)
[for short CIT(A)], and the CIT(A) allowed the appeals of
the Assessee.

ITA No.1552/2006

6.

Being aggrieved with the order of CIT(A), the

Revenue preferred an appeal before the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal (for short as „Tribunal‟) and vide

the

impugned order, the appeal filed by the Revenue was
dismissed by the Tribunal. Thus, the Revenue has filed an
appeal before this Court.
7.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the

Revenue

that

Assessee

had

merely

introduced

new

technology and new plant and machinery for two items,
whereas for other things, the earlier machines were being
used. Further, most of the production was being carried
out by using the old plant and machinery and merely
capacity of the Assessee unit was increased which goes on
to show that it was the case of expansion of old industrial
undertaking with some modifications and no new industrial
undertaking

came

into

existence

and

the

Assessee

continued to manufacture same products and continued to
operate the old machinery and plant.
8.

On the other hand, it has been contended by learned

counsel for the Assessee that after collaboration with two
international pioneers in the field of dairy whitener and

ITA No.1552/2006

Page 5 of 11

milk powder, the entire complexion of the Assessee‟s
industrial unit was changed. The Assessee had made fresh
investment in plant and machinery amounting to Rs.104.88
lacs.

Further, the old unit became unviable with coming

into existence of new industrial undertakings backed with
latest technology, higher efficiency and better quality
product.

The Assessing Officer

himself has stated that

there was a complete absorption of the old business by the
new unit and this absorption makes it all the clear that in
certain

part

of

the

year,

both

the

units

existed

independently simultaneously and the old unit gradually
faded away after coming into the existence of new
industrial unit.

All these facts goes on to show that the

new unit set up by the Assessee was not formed either by
splitting up of the existing industrial undertaking or formed
by reconstruction or rehabilitation of an undertaking.

In

support of his contention, learned counsel for the Assessee
has cited a decision of the Supreme Court reported as

Textile Machinery Corporation Ltd. vs. CIT [1997]
107 ITR 195 (SC).

Section 80-IA (2) of the Act applies to any industrial

undertaking which fulfills all the following conditions,
namely:(i)

It is not formed by splitting up, or the
reconstruction, of a business already in
existence.

(ii)

It is not formed by the transfer to a new
business of machinery or plant previously
used for any purpose and in case it is
transferred then the total value of the old
machinery or plant or part so transferred
does not exceed 20% of the total value of
the machinery or plant used in the
business.

(iii)

It manufactures or produces any article
thing, not being any article specified
the list in the Eleventh Schedule,
operates one or more cold storage plant
plants, in any part of India.

The term "splitting up of the business already in

existence" indicates a case where the integrity of a
business earlier in existence is broken up and different
sections of the activities previously conducted are carried
on independently. [CIT v. Hindustan General Industries

Ltd. [1982] 137 ITR 851 (Delhi)].

v.

As observed by Supreme Court in Textile Machinery

CIT

[1997]

107

ITR

19(SC),

“The

term

‘reconstruction’ implies that the identity of the business
should not be lost, and substantially the same business
should be carried on by substantially the same person. The
true test is not whether the new industrial undertaking
connotes expansion of the existing business of the Assessee
but whether it is all the same a new and identifiable
undertaking

separate

and

distinct

from

the

existing

business”.
12.

As per findings of fact recorded by the Tribunal, it has

been stated that “in the present case the old undertaking
no longer existed and remained identifiable.

It was

completely submerged in the new industrial undertaking of
the Assessee.

The provisions of Section 80IA of the Act

with reference to Explanation 2, do not require that new
industrial undertaking should be raised on separate plot of
land leaving the earlier undertaking totally untouched.
We find that the processes for which the Assessee entered
into

technological

collaborations

with

M/s

Rotacom

Industries, B.V., Netherlands and M/s Seppo Ralli OY,

ITA No.1552/2006

Page 8 of 11

Finland were the key processes of the Assessee‟s industrial
undertaking and other processes such as storage of milk in
stainless steel storage tanks, pre-warming, pre-heating,
pasteurization were only of preparatory nature for the
manufacturing of the product of the Assessee.

The

Assessee appears to have introduced almost entirely new
manufacturing technology and processes.”
13.

The reconstruction of a business or an industrial

undertaking must necessarily involve the concept that the
original

business

or

undertaking

is

not

to

cease

functioning, and its identity is not to be set to be lost or
abandoned. The concept essentially rests on changes but
the changes must be constructive and not destructive.
There must be something positive about the whole matter
as

opposed

to

negative.

The

underlying

idea

of

a

reconstruction evidently must be - and this is brought out
by the section itself - of a 'business already in existence'.
There must be a continuation of the activities and business
of the same industrial undertaking. The undertaking must
continue to carry on the same business though in some
altered or varied form. If the alteration and changes are
ITA No.1552/2006

Page 9 of 11

substantial, there would be little scope for describing what
emerges as a reconstruction of the business. (See CIT v.

Gaekwar Foam and Rubber Co. Ltd. [1959] 35 ITR
662 [Bom.]
14.

From the perusal of Section 80-IA of the Act it is clear

that the statute itself has envisaged and approved of a
situation in which an old existing smaller industrial
undertaking is absorbed by a new much bigger industrial
undertaking.
15.
there

In the present case, only capacity was increased and
was

expansion

of

old

business

with

some

modifications. As for „reconstruction‟ of the business, it is
nowhere evident that the old industrial unit was split up or
damaged or destroyed that was supposedly reconstructed
as a new unit by the assessee. What the Assessee has done
is to set up an industrial undertaking with latest technology
and with increased capacity and of course, with a fairly
good amount of fresh investment.
16.

The formation of the new undertaking is not as a

consequence of the transfer of the plant or machinery of
the old business. The value of the plant and machinery
ITA No.1552/2006

Page 10 of 11

utilized in the new undertaking has been less than 20% of
the total investment. Thus, the assessee‟s case also does
not get disqualified under this provision.
Investment in new plant and machinery was
Rs.104.88 Lacs.
Investment in old plant and machinery was
Rs.20.86 Lacs.
17.

Therefore, in this view of the matter, the conclusion is

inevitable that the assessee was entitled to deduction
under section 80-IA in respect of the profits of the new
industrial undertaking having satisfied the conditions.
18.

Thus no infirmity can be found with the impugned

order of the Tribunal.
19.

In view of the above, no substantial question of law

arises for consideration.
20.

The appeals are accordingly dismissed.
