1.

The petitioner has come before this Court against an order

passed by the Industrial Tribunal No.II, Karkardooma Courts,
Delhi on 21st February, 2002 whereby the respondent/DTC was
granted approval under Section 33(2) (b) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947. The petitioner has come to this Court after
nearly six years. It appears that the petitioner's services were
terminated by the respondent on 20th November, 1991. At that
time, since another Labour dispute was pending, the DTC
applied to the Industrial Tribunal under Section 33(2) (b). This

approval was granted by the Industrial Tribunal on 21st February,
2002 as aforesaid. Consequently, the petitioner's services stood
terminated. Dissatisfied by his termination, the petitioner raised
an industrial dispute which was referred to the Industrial
Tribunal. An award was given by the Industrial Tribunal on 9th
May, 2003 dismissing his claim.

The petitioner thereafter

invoked the writ jurisdiction of this Court by filing Writ Petition
No.6196/2004 wherein he challenged the award dated 9th May,
2003 by which his claim was dismissed. On 27th July, 2006, Writ
Petition No.6196/2004 also came to be dismissed, thereby
confirming the award dated 9th May, 2003. The petitioner does
not appear to have taken the matter any further. He has now
come to this Court by way of challenge to the aforesaid order of
21st February, 2002 whereby permission was granted to the
respondent under Section 33(2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes
Act.
2.

Counsel for the petitioner has sought to explain this

inordinate delay by stating that the petitioner was otherwise
engaged in pursuing his challenge to his termination of 20th
November, 1991 before the Labour Court which ultimately
resulted in the aforesaid award dated 9th May, 2003 and
thereafter

he

was

engaged

in

pursuing

Writ

Petition

No.6196/2004 which was finally dismissed on 27th July, 2006. He
says that it was because these matters were pending that his
client was unable to move this Court earlier against the
impugned order of 21st February, 2002.

I do not find any force in this contention. On the contrary,

the fact that the petitioner was actively engaged in pursuing his
legal remedies, first by contesting the application moved by the
DTC under Section 33(2) (b), and thereafter the proceedings
before the Labour Court which resulted in the award dated 9th
May, 2003 against him and ultimately in filing Writ Petition
No.6196/2004 which was dismissed on 27th July, 2006, shows
that he was active and vigorous in seeking his remedies. There
is therefore no reason why the petitioner could not have
assailed the impugned order also within reasonable time.
4.

Counsel for the petitioner has also failed to draw my

attention to any impediment that prevented the petitioner from
approaching this Court earlier in the matter. Nor has any such
impediment been pleaded. Indeed, to my mind, there could not
be any impediment.
5.

Counsel further states that after the order of 21st February,

2002 under Section 33(2) (b), the petitioner in fact chose not to
challenge it at that time. In that case, the petitioner has only
himself to blame. There is no gainsaying the fact that the cause
of action, if any, to challenge the impugned order of 21st
February, 2002 arose in favour of the petitioner on that date
itself. Yet he chose not to challenge the said order during all
this time. It is noteworthy that on 9.5.2003 itself he knew that
the approval granted by the Industrial Tribunal under Section
33(2) (b) is the reason for denial of the relief sought by him
before the Labour Court. Thereafter on 27.7.2006 also, he knew
WP(C) No.1603/2008

Page 3 of 4

that the writ court had also upheld the Labour Court's decision
to deny him relief because of that approval. Yet he approaches
this Court only in February, 2008.

I do not see how he can

maintain his challenge today merely on the ground that
according to him, all the other proceedings have been decided
against him because of the approval granted by the Industrial
Tribunal on 21.2.2002. Ex facie, these findings do not give rise
to any fresh cause of action in the petitioner's favour to impugn
the order passed six years ago on 21.2.2002. The fact remains
that he is approaching this Court after an inordinate period of six
years and, as stated in the maxim, Vigilantibus, et non
dormientibus, jura subveniunt – The vigilant and not the
sleepy are assisted by the laws. I therefore see no reason to
entertain this petition.
The writ petition is dismissed.
