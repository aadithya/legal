A question that frequently engages the attention of our tax courts has been

referred for our opinion by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench
“D”, New Delhi ('Tribunal') under Section 256(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961
('the Act') for the Assessment Years 1975-76 and 1980-81 arising out of the
Tribunal's order dated 20th April, 1985 in ITA No. 5404& 5405 (Del)/1983.
While ITR No. 113 of 1986 is a reference at the instance of the Revenue, ITR
Nos. 114 and 115 of 1986 are references at the instance of the Assessee. That
question is whether a sum received by an Assessee should be treated for the
purposes of the Act as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt. The large volume of
precedents of the High Courts and the Supreme Court on the point underscores

ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 1 of 15

the difficulty in easily answering what appears to be a fairly simple question.
The precedent volume grows larger with this judgment.

2.

First, the facts. The Assessee took on lease two cinema halls, „Capital‟

and „Minerva‟ at Ambala. Since 1952 it was exhibiting films in them and
earning a part of its income from that activity. The cinema halls were owned by
one Lala Beli Ram Sarin. The last time the lease was renewed was in 1968 for a
term of six years and three months from 1st December, 1968 to 28th February,
1975 on a consolidated sum of Rs.72,000/- per year. From a copy of the lease
deed which has been included in the paper book it appears that the lease was of
not only the cinema halls. It included the stalls, godowns and cinema
equipments. The lease deed acknowledged that the Assessee had renovated the
cinema halls and that future repairs would be at the cost of lessee subject to the
condition that the lessee would inform the lessor in advance of his proposal to
carry out repairs, renovations and additions.

The lessee was to hand over

peaceful possession of the cinema halls along with its equipments to the lessor
on the expiry of the lease. The lessee was prohibited from transferring or subletting the leasehold rights to any third party except for the stalls where
contractors could be appointed.

3.

On 1st December, 1975 the owner of the two cinema halls, Lala Beli Ram

Sarin, wrote to the Assessee reminding it that the lease was to expire on 28 th
February, 1975 but that the lessor was willing to extend the period of lease for
another five years commencing from 1 st March, 1975 and ending on 28th
February, 1980 at a consolidated rent of Rs.10,000/- per month. However it
appears that during the further negotiations that took place, the parties agreed
that the Assessee would hand over the possession the cinema halls to the lessor
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 2 of 15

on or before 28th February, 1975 and to treat the letter dated 1st February, 1975
written by the lessor as cancelled. The terms of this arrangement were reduced
to writing in a letter dated 21st February, 1975 written by the landlord to the
Assessee which, inter alia, stated that the lessor would pay the lessee a sum of
Rs.1,24,000/- in lieu of the loss of business and by way of compensation for
handing back the possession of the two cinema halls. It was further agreed that
apart from this, the lessor would pay the lessee a further sum of Rs.2,00,000/- in
five equal instalments of Rs.40,000/- each ending with 28th February, 1980.

4. The relevant portion of the aforementioned letter dated 21 st February, 1975
written by the landlord to the Assessee reads as under:
“I write this to confirm my agreement that in consideration of
your agreeing to treat my said letter dated 1st February, 1975, as
cancelled and the said extension of lease as revoked and agreeing
to hand back the possession of both the cinemas to me on or
before and as on 28th February, 1975, I have agreed to pay to you
a sum of Rs.1,24,000/- (Rupees one lac twenty four thousand) in
lieu of your loss of business and by way of compensation for
handing back the possession of the said two cinemas as on the
28th February, 1975, and also a sum of Rs.40,000/- (Rupees forty
thousand) for every year of the extended lease period of five
years as under:1.Rs.40,000/- for period from 1st March, 1975 to 28th Feby. 1976.
2.Rs.40,000/- for period from 1st March, 1976 to 28th Feby. 1977.
3.Rs.40,000/- for period from 1st March, 1977 to 28th Feby. 1978.
4.Rs.40,000/- for period from 1st March, 1978 to 28th Feby. 1979.
5.Rs.40,000/- for period from 1st March, 1979 to 28th Feby.1980.”

5.

It was further undertaken by the landlord as under:
“In case I do not pay this money to you on or before 1 st April,
1975, you are at liberty to file a suit for its recovery in the Courts
at Delhi. I agree to give you proper receipt for all the machinery,
equipment, furniture, etc. and also receipt for having taken
possession of the said cinema premises. I confirm that with the
signing of the said receipt for the machinery, equipment, furniture
etc., I have no claim against you for anything whatsoever and this

ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 3 of 15

handing over of the cinemas in the manner provided above is in
full and final settlement.”
6.

It is not in dispute that during the Assessment Year 1975-76 the sum of

Rs.1,24,000/- was in fact paid to the Assessee and the balance of Rs.2,00,000/was paid in five equal instalments in the succeeding years i.e. from the
Assessment Year 1976-77 onwards. In the accounts prepared for the year ending
on 28th February, 1975 the Assessee showed the sum of Rs.1,24,000/- in the
credit side of the Profit & Loss Account ('P&L Account') under the heading
“compensation for premature closure of the cinema halls at Ambala”. In the
accounts for each of the subsequent years beginning from 1976-77 and ending
with the Assessment Year 1980-81, the Assessee showed the sum of Rs.40,000/payable to it by Lala Beli Ram Sarin on the credit side of its P&L Account.
Therefore for the Assessment Year 1975-76 a sum of Rs. 1,24,000/- was offered
by the Assessee for taxation as a revenue receipt whereas for the Assessment
Year 1980-81, Rs. 40,000/- was offered for taxation.

7.

In the Assessment Order dated 29th September, 1977 the Income Tax

Officer ('ITO') assessed the entire sum of Rs.3,24,000/- as a revenue receipt in
the hands of the Assessee for the Assessment Year 1975-76 on accrual basis.
Aggrieved by the order of the ITO, the Assessee filed an appeal before the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) ['CIT(A)']. It was the Assessee's case
that no part of the sum of Rs.3,24,000/- was chargeable to tax since this
constituted compensation received for the loss of the profit or income yielding
apparatus and therefore the sum received as compensation for the
extinguishment of such right would only be a capital receipt. By an order dated
15th September, the CIT(A) accepted this plea and allowed the appeal of the
Assessee. The CIT (A) held that the sum of Rs.3,24,000/- was a capital receipt
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 4 of 15

and therefore not taxable.

8.

The Revenue then appealed to the Tribunal. Relying on the decision of the

Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v. Shamsher Printing Press
(1960) 39 ITR 90 (SC), the Revenue contended that the sum of Rs. 1,24,000/was only a revenue receipt since admittedly the sum was given to it as
compensation for the loss of business. The case of the Assessee was that the
mere fact that the Assessee had offered Rs.1,24,000/- for tax ought not be seen
as a concession by it that the said sum constituted a revenue receipt.

9.

The Tribunal by its judgment dated 20th April, 1985 reversed the order of

the CIT(A) and directed that Rs.1,24,000/- be included in the Assessee‟s taxable
income for the Assessment Year 1975-76. It further directed that an addition of
Rs.40,000/- should be made to the Assessee's taxable income for the Assessment
Year 1980-81. This order has given rise to the present rerferences to this Court.

10.

The question that has been referred to us at the instance of the Revenue,

is:
“Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the case the
Tribunal was justified in holding that even though Rs.3,24,000/was a revenue receipt, the entire of it did not become assessable in
the assessment year 1975-76 only Rs.1,24,000/- became assessable
and that the remaining sum of Rs.2,00,000/- accrued to the
assessee company to terms of the aforesaid agreement at the
expiry of the following accounting periods:(i)

For the period from 1st March, 1975 to 28th Feb., 1976
Rs.40,000

(ii)

For the period from 1st March, 1976 to 28th Feb., 1977
Rs.40,000

(iii) For the period from 1st March, 1977 to 28th Feb., 1978
Rs.40,000

ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 5 of 15

(iv) For the period from 1st March, 1978 to 28th Feb., 1979
Rs.40,000
(v)

11.

For the period from 1st March, 1979 to 28th Feb., 1980
Rs.40,000”

The two questions referred to us at the instance of the Assessee are:
“(i) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in holding that the sum of Rs.
3,24,000/- realised by the assessee by way of compensation
for the termination of the lease of the two cinemas namely
Minerva and Capital at Ambala by the lessor constituted a
revenue receipt thereby resulting in the income of
Rs.1,24,000/- chargeable to tax in the assessment year 197576?
(ii) Whether on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the Tribunal was right in holding that the sum of Rs.
3,24,000/- realised by the assessee by way of compensation
for the termination of the lease of the two cinemas namely
Minerva and Capital at Ambala by the lessor constituted a
revenue receipt thereby resulting in the income of
Rs.40,000/- chargeable to tax in the assessment year 198081?”

12.

Appearing for the Revenue Mr. J.R.Goel, learned senior standing counsel

submitted that the sum of Rs.3.24 lakhs received by the Assessee from the
lessor for loss of business was a revenue receipt as the entire income had
accrued during the Assessment Year 1975-76 itself. In other words, as per the
mercantile system of accounting, which the Assessee undoubtedly followed, the
said income had accrued in this very year notwithstanding the fact that the sum
of Rs.1.24 lakhs was received in the previous year and the remaining sum of
Rs.2 lakhs was received in five equal instalments of Rs.40,000/- each in the
subsequent years. He further submitted that the extinguishment of the lease of
the cinema halls did not bring the entire business of the Assessee to a halt. The
Assessee was exhibiting films in cinema halls in other places and earning
income and therefore the compensation received for extinguishment of the lease
of the two cinema halls at Ambala cannot be treated as a capital receipt. He
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 6 of 15

placed reliance on a decision of the Supreme Court in Shamsher Printing Press
to contend that the compensation received for termination of lease is not liable
to be treated as a capital receipt in the facts of the present case.

13.

Mr. P.N.Monga, learned counsel appearing for the Assessee on the other

hand contended that the profit making apparatus of the Assessee had been totally
crippled and the source of income had been rendered sterile. Relying on the
decisions in Chunduri Venkata Reddi v. Commissioner of Income-Tax,
Madras (1959) 35 ITR 87 (AP), Commissioner of Income-Tax, Mysore v.
Canara Bank Ltd. (1967) 63 ITR 328 (SC), Lakshmi Insurance Co. (P.) Ltd. v.
Commissioner of Income-Tax, New Delhi (1971) 80 ITR 575 (Del), Bombay
Burma Trading Corp. Ltd v. CIT, Bombay (1971) 81 ITR 777 (affirmed by the
Supreme Court in 1986 161 ITR 386), Bawa Shivcharan Singh v. CIT, Delhi
(1984) 149 ITR 29 (Del), B.G.Shah v. CIT (1986) 162 ITR 23 (Bom),
H.L.Sidappa v. CIT (1980) 126 ITR 641 (Kar) and K.Eapen Jacob v.
Commissioner of Income Tax (1987) 166 ITR 199 (Mad).

Mr. Monga

contended that the sum of Rs.3,24,000/- had to be necessarily treated as a capital
receipt which is not available to tax. According to Mr.Monga, the mere fact that
there were other cinema halls elsewhere from which the Assessee was earning
income by exhibiting films did not change the character of the compensation
received by the Assessee; it continued to remain a capital receipt.

14.

Without prejudice to the above contention, Mr.Monga submits that the

sum of Rs.1,24,000/- alone is liable to be treated as revenue receipt in the hands
of the Assessee for the relevant Assessment Year 1975-76. He points to the
letter dated 21st February, 1975 in which it is clearly indicated that it is only the
sum of Rs.1,24,000/- which has been offered as compensation for the business
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 7 of 15

loss and that the remainder sum of Rs. 2 lakhs was payable in five equal
instalments of Rs.40,000/- each in the years folling the Assessment Year 197576. In fact, the Assessee did offer for tax the said sum of Rs.40,000/- in the
subsequent Assessmemt Years. The stand of the Revenue that the entire sum of
Rs.3.24 lakhs should be taxed in the Assessment year 1975-76 is contrary to
what it submitted to the Tribunal. Referring to the judgment in Shamsher
Printing Press Mr. Monga points out that if the case of the Revenue were to be
accepted and the entire amount of Rs. 3.24 lakhs is brought to tax in the
Assessment Year 1975-76, the component of Rs.2 lakhs which has already been
subjected to tax in the subsequent Assessment Years will again have to be taxed
in the Assessment Year 1975-76 which is contrary to the settled legal position
that no income can be subjected to tax twice over.

15. The first question that requires to be answered is whether the sum of
Rs.3,24,000/- constituted a revenue receipt thereby resulting in the income of
Rs. 1,24,000/- being chargeable to tax in the Assessment Year 1975-76 and the
sum of Rs.40,000/- being chargeable to tax in the Assessment Year 1980-81.

16.

Among the early decisions in which the question whether a sum received

by way of compensation was a revenue receipt or a capital receipt was
considered was that handed down by the Privy Council in Commissioner of
Income-tax v. Shaw Wallace and Company AIR 1932 PC 138. The question
there was whether a sum of Rs.9,83,361/- which had been included in the total
income of the Assessee and received as compensation for cessation of the
agency or loss of office was a capital receipt or a revenue receipt. In holding
that it was a capital receipt, the Privy Council observed (AIR, p.141):
“If the business had been sold – even if that somewhat
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 8 of 15

indeterminate asset known as the “goodwill” had been
assigned to the employing companies, as the High Court
seems to have thought it had – it is conceded that the price
paid would not have been taxable. But why? Plainly because
it could not be regarded as profit or gain from carrying on
the business, and their Lordships think that the same
reasoning must apply when the sum received is in the nature
of a solatium for cessation.”
What weighed the Privy Council was whether there was a complete cessation of
business. That would determine whether the compensation received was a
capital receipt or a revenue receipt.

17.

In Commissioner of Income Tax v. South India Pictures Ltd. (1956) 29

ITR 910 (SC), the Assessee was carrying on the business of distribution of
films. For this purpose it had entered into three agreements for advancing
moneys to certain motion picture producers towards production of three films
and acquiring the rights of distribution thereof. After the Assessee had exploited
to a certain extent its right of distribution of three films, the agreements were
cancelled and the producers paid an aggregate sum of Rs.26,000/- to the
Assessee towards commission. In the relevant accounting year the Assessee had
distribution rights in respect of 11 films including 3 films for which it had
advanced moneys to the producers. The question then arose whether the sum of
Rs.26,000/- was a revenue receipt in the hands of the Assessee. By a 2:1 the
Supreme Court held that the sum paid to the Assessee was in the ordinary course
of business and that the termination of the agreement did not radically affect or
alter the structure of the Assessee's business. It clarified that the amount was not
received by the Assessee as the price of any capital asset sold or surrendered or
destroyed. It was held that the decision in Shaw Wallace would not apply in
such a case. Again, what appears to have weighed with the Court in South India
Pictures Ltd. was that there was no total cessation of the Asseessee's business
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 9 of 15

and that the termination of the agreements “did not radically or at all affect or
alter the structure of the Assessee's business.” This then appears to be the
critical test for determining whether the amount received by way of
compensation is a revenue receipt or a capital receipt.

18.

The question was again addressed by the Supreme Court in Shamsher

Printing Press. The Assessee had for the purposes of his business housed a
printing press in a premises which came to be requisitioned by the Government
in September 1943 for the duration of war. This compelled the Assessee to shift
and restart its business in another place. A sum of Rs.57,435/- was paid by the
Government towards the claim made by the Assessee “on account of the
compulsory vacation of the premises, disturbance and loss of business.” The
Supreme Court held that the compensation received was not towards loss of
goodwill. It noted that the claim of the Assessee was under three distinct heads:
(a) compulsory vacation of premises (b) disturbance of business and (c) loss of
business. The Supreme Court then concluded as under (ITR, pp.93-94):
“It seems to us for the reasons aforesaid that the sum of
Rs.57,435/- had not been received by the respondent for any
injury to any of its capital assets. In our view, the sum was
received as compensation for loss of profits for the period
during which, it was imagined, the respondent's business
would remain stopped before it could be re-started at a new
premises. That being so, it was clearly a revenue receipt; it
has not been disputed that if the amount in question was paid
as compensation for loss of profit, it would be a revenue
receipt and liable to tax.”
19.

It appears to us that the facts in Shamsher Printing Press are not very

different from the facts on hand. The slight difference is that here the Assessee
has been compensated by the landlord towards the business loss resulting from it
having to vacate premises which did not belong to it but which were in its
possession pursuant to a lease. Coupled with this is the undisputed fact that the
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 10 of 15

Assessee had been carrying on the business of distribution and exhibition of
films in other cinema halls located in the cities of Jagraon, Yamuna Nagar and
Moga. In the circumstances, following the dictum in Shamsher Printing Press
it must be held that the compensation amount received by the Assessee towards
the business loss was in fact a revenue receipt.

20.

Reliance was placed by the learned counsel for the Assessee on the

decision of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in Chunduri Venkata Reddi.

It

was held by the High Court in that case that the test for determining whether a
sum of money is a capital receipt or a revenue receipt was as under (ITR,p.96):
“The amount should have been paid for parting with something which
could be described as an enduring asset of the business. The cessation of
the business or the cancellation of the agreement should affect the profitmaking structure. To quote the words “it should materially destroy or
cripple the structure of the profit-making apparatus.”

The decision in Chunduri Venkata Reddi, apart from reiterating the well settled
law does not particularly help the case of the Assessee since it is distinguishable
on facts. Unless the Assessee here is able to demonstrate that there was a
compulsory cessation of Assessee's business and that the source of income was
rendered sterile, it will not be able to demonstrate that the sum paid by the
landlord to the Assessee was a capital receipt.

21. Reliance was also place on the decision of the Supreme Court in Canara
Bank Ltd. The facts in that case were that the Respondent Assessee had opened
the branch of its Bank in Karachi on 15th November, 1946. After the partition of
India in 1947 the currencies of the two countries i.e. India and Pakistan,
continued to be at par until 18th September, 1949 when there was a devaluation
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 11 of 15

of the Indian rupee. On that day the Assessee had a sum of Rs.3,97,221/- at the
Karachi branch which belonged to its Head Office. The exchange ratio between
the two countries was not determined until 27 th November, 1951. The Bank in
any event did not carry on any business and in particular foreign exchange
business. The State Bank of Pakistan granted permission on 1st July, 1953 to the
Assessee to remit the amount to India. In that process, the Assessee made a
profit of Rs.1,73,487/- in view of the difference in the value of the currencies. It
was held on those facts that the realisation of the profit was not in the course of
any trading operation.

It was a capital receipt since even if the amount

represented stock-in-trade, it was blocked and sterilised. It was clarified that if
the profit was earned by exchange operations and “not by way of business of the
Assessee, the profit would be capital.” In the instant case however the Assessee
had received sum as compensation for business loss and therefore the receipt of
the said sum is clearly only a revenue receipt.

22.

The question that arose in Lakshmi Insurance Co. (P.) Ltd. was whether

the sum of Rs.56,028/- paid as compensation by the Central Government to the
Assessee Company which conducted a life insurance business was a revenue
receipt in its hands. This Court held that on the facts of that case there was a
complete cessation of the activity of the management and that “the divesting of
its management was really divesting the assessee-company of its property, the
compensation paid was, therefore, was for a loss of a capital asset.” It was
therefore held that “compensation paid to the Assessee company is not income.”
The contention of the Revenue that the continuation of the business of the
Assessee company would disable it from claiming the sum received as capital
receipt was negatived by the Court. It was observed as under (ITR, p.581):
“The significant point to be noticed is that there was no
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 12 of 15

complete cessation of the business of the assessee even upon
the termination of the two agencies of the assessee.
Therefore, even if the revenue is right in saying that the
business of the assessee-company in the present case
continued despite the divesting of its management as a result
of the said Ordinance and the said Act, it is to be seen
whether the compensation paid was income or whether it
was for the divesting of a part of its profit-making apparatus.
The compensation paid cannot be said to be in respect of the
profits or gains of any business carried on by the assesseecompany nor can it be profit earned by a process of
production according to the test laid down by the Privy
Council.”
The above decision was peculiar to the facts of the case. The important
distinguishing feature in the present case is that the correspondence between the
parties itself indicates that the sum paid by way of compensation was clearly for
the loss of business.

23.

The facts in K.Eapen Jacob were that the sum was paid under a

compromise and as compensation for the Assessee surrendering the source of
his income namely, the share in the partnership. In those circumstances since
the very source of the income of the Assessee was rendered sterile, the Madras
High Court held that the amount received by way of compensation was only a
capital receipt. Again, the said decision is clearly distinguishable in the
applicability to the facts of the present case.

24.

Mr. Monga sought to place reliance on the decision of this Court in Bawa

Shivcharan Singh where the Assessee received a sum of Rs.30,000/- for
surrendering tenancy rights of the first floor of the premises under its
occupation. This Court sought to distinguish the type of payment received by
the Assessee. It was observed by this Court as under (ITR, p.33):
“The consideration for a lease may be “of a price paid or
promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other
ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 13 of 15

thing of value, to be rendered periodically or on specified
occasions to the transferor by the transferee.” Normally, the
initial amount paid for the acquisition of the leasehold right
is “premium” “pagri”, “salami” or by whatever name it may
be called. This is in consideration for being let in possession.
The consideration for relinquishment of the tenancy rights
may again be a lump sum called “pagri”. The periodical
payment in terms of money for the use and occupation of the
premises is called rent or lease money. What distinguishes
rent from “premium” is that the latter represents money paid
as a price or a consideration for being let in possession.
“Pagri” is a consideration for the cessation or surrender of
the property or the relinquishment of the leasehold rights.”
As far as the present case is concerned it bears repetition that the compensation
received was not so much for the loss of premises but for the business loss that
would ensue therefrom. Moreover, the Assessee was exhibiting films in other
cinema halls and therefore there was no cessation of its business of a permanent
nature.
25.

This Court is of the considered view that there was no complete cessation

of the Assessee's business activity. It cannot be said that any part of the profitmaking apparatus of the Assessee had been extinct so as to render the amount of
compensation received for the said purpose a capital receipt. The sum of
Rs.1,24,000/- received by the Assessee in the Assessment Year 1975-76 was a
revenue receipt and not a capital receipt. The two questions referred at the
instance of the Assessee are therefore answered in the affirmative, that is, in
favour of the Revenue and against the Assessee.

26.

The question referred at the instance of the Revenue whether the entire

sum of Rs.3,24,000/- became assessable to tax in the Assessment year 1975-76
as contended by the Revenue or only a sum of Rs.1,24,000/- should be assessed
to tax since that was the amount received during the Assessment Year is taken
up for discussion next.

ITR Nos. 113-115 of 1986

page 14 of 15

27.

The evidence on record clearly indicates that the correspondence between

the landlord and the Assessee unambiguously states that a sum of Rs.1,24,000/has been paid towards his loss of business. The further sum of Rs.2 lakhs does
not bear any such particular description in order to determine whether such sum
accrued in that very Assessment Year 1975-76. This coupled with the fact that
the Assessee had in fact offered to tax the sum of Rs.40,000/- in every
succeeding Assessment Year including 1980-81 indicates that there is no
attempt by the Assessee to avoid payment of tax in those Assessment Years. If
the said sum of Rs.2 lakhs is brought to tax in the year 1975-76 it will doubtless
amount to double taxation of the same amount since admittedly a sum of
Rs.40,000/- has been offered to tax by the Assessee in each of the succeeding
Assessment Years as a revenue receipt.

28.

In that view of the matter this Court is of the view that the question posed

at the instance of the Revenue should be answered in the affirmative, that is, in
favour of the Assessee and against the Revenue.

29.

The reference petitions are accordingly disposed of.
