Mr. Justice S. Ravindra Bhat:
1.

The petitioners seek a direction to the respondents that the letters issued by

them, should be withdrawn and that the respondents should be directed to comply with the
orders of court dated 17th December, 2002 in WP No. 7155/2001.
2.

The Supreme Court through a number of directions,

required closure of

industrial and manufacturing units which were operating in areas which did not conform to
the norms described by the existing master plan.

Such units were closed down on 31st

December, 1996. As a measure to rehabilitate the owners of such irregularly operating units,
directions had been issued to the respondent authorities to acquire land and develop it for

wpc-6447-49/2004

1 of 7

suitable reallocation on the basis of appropriately evolved criteria. Therefore, the respondents
acquired lands in different places and developed them, and Bawana was one such locality. In
terms of the scheme formulated by the respondents, the tentative land cost was declared as
Rs.3000/- per square metre.

This was later enhanced to Rs.4200/- per square metre.

Subsequently, a large number of eligible applicants were allotted plots.
3.

In terms of the scheme evolved by the respondent, a time schedule for payment

of consideration for the plots had been prescribed. Several allottees , however, could not pay
these amounts within time.

These issues were considered by this Court as well as the

Supreme Court which directed that, as a final opportunity, the allottees should be granted time
till 31st March, 2001 to deposit 50% of the amount.
4.

On 25th September, 2001 the Delhi State Industrial Development Corporation

(DSIDC) wrote to the allottees informing them that the balance 50% of the cost of the plot
had to be paid by 31st October, 2001 . This decision, and the increase in the cost were
challenged in a batch of cases before this Court being CW 7150/01 and connected cases. The
Court had by its interim order dated 12.8.2002, directed all those allottees who had not paid
70% of the cost of land on the revised basis, to do so within two weeks from that order and
that the 3rd installment of the 20% of the cost be paid six months thereafter. The Court also
directed that the balance of the actual cost was to be paid at the time of handing over of the
possession of the plot.
5.

The writ petition was disposed of on 17.12.2002 inter alia in terms of the

following directions :After hearing counsel for the parties, the order
which commends to the court for accelerating the development of
the Project and bringing finality to the matter as also fair to the
parties, is as follows:“Allottees who have paid 50% of the estimated cost
wpc-6447-49/2004

2 of 7

by March, 2001, but fell in default thereafter, may make the
payment of the 20% instalment due together with interest at 18%
PA from 6th December, 2002 on or before 31st December, 2002;
Payment of the next instalment of 20% by 31st
December, 2002 without payment of interest.
Allottees who have been sent/received intimation
with regard to the possession being handed over, may take
possession upon payment of the balance 10% of the estimated
cost.
It is clarified that if the second installment of 20%
which was payable by 6.12.2002 is paid by 31.12.2002, no
interest would be charged.
Mr. Tulsi States that the DSIDC would accept
payments in accordance with the above directions without
insisting upon copies of the orders or certified copies of the
orders in individual cases.”
6.

The petitioners claim to be members of the Bawana Industrial Plot

Owners Welfare Association.

They represented on 26.11.2002 alleging that the DSIDC had

failed to develop this site for reallocation and refused to hand over the possession. They also
submitted that their members should not be charged with any interest for the old payment of
the installments. This representation was dealt with by the DSIDC in its letter dated 8.1.2003.
The relevant part of the said letter reads as follows:“As far as the request of the association for
not charging the 18% interest on the delayed payment is
concerned, it may not be out of place to state that since the
allottees did not come forward to make the payment of the
cost of plots up to the due dates given to them free of interest
from time to time, the DSIDC was left with option to charge
interest on late payments with the approval of Govt. of Delhi.
This step was considered necessary to step up the response of
payment/funds required to carry on the developmental work
of land acquired for relocation of industries. Further, the
other request of association to provide the benefits of court
decision to all orders passed by the hon'ble court where
restricted to the petitioners only after hearing their writ
petitions. “
7.

It is averred that the respondents, including the DSIDC are indulging in

wpc-6447-49/2004

3 of 7

discriminatory treatment, depriving the petitioner association and its members of the rightful
benefit accruing in terms of the order of this court. It is claimed that the benefit of payment
directed by the court was applicable to one and all; therefore, the respondents could not single
out those who did not approach the court but awarded its decision.

It is claimed that all the

petitioners paid the instalment of 20% by 31st December, 2002 and indeed deposited all the
amounts, in tune with the orders of this court, and therefore, should not be charged any
interest.
8.

In the light of the above facts , this court has to decide whether the interim

orders made on 24.5.2002 and 17.12.2002 were all universal or general application or whether
they would be confined to the petitioners and parties before the Court.
9.

It is not in dispute that all the petitioners were allottees of the plots which they

got by virtue of their having irregularly operated manufacturing units in places which ought
not to have been there.

According to the scheme for the development of such plots, the

allottees were to deposit installments according to a schedule. A large number of allottees did
not comply with the schedule. The Supreme Court intervened and

fixed 31st March, 2003 as

the deadline by which the 50% of the plot cost had to be deposited.

In the meanwhile the

DSIDC increased the cost of the plot from Rs.3000/- to Rs.4200/- per square metre. It also
required the allottees to deposit a 7.5% security deposit and in addition, rescheduled the
payment of balance 50%. According to the new stipulation that amount had to be paid by 31st
October, 2002. These events triggered the round of litigation by which WP No. 7155/2001
was filed in this court. The records of that case were called for in these proceedings.

The

writ petition was finally disposed of by a judgment dated 31.3.2003 . It was heard along with
a batch of 32 other cases. WP No. 7155/2001 had been preferred by the Bawana Relegated
Industrial Plot Owners Association with a declared membership of 1101 plot owners. The
wpc-6447-49/2004

4 of 7

other 32 petitioners who filed similar cases were individual plot owners.

This then was the

broad context of the previous litigation.
10.

The first interim order relieved all allottees from the obligation to deposit

security deposit.

Secondly, it made a distinction between those before the court and the

allottees who had not approached. This apparent from the following extract which forms the
last part of the order dated 12.8.2002 :-

12.

“Civil Writ Nos. 1150/2001, 7155/2001,
7361/2001, 7819/2001 and 7918/2001 has been filed by the
Associations on behalf of their members. Order passed today
will apply not only to the Associations but also to the members
of the Associations whose list is stated to have been furnished by
the Associations to the DSIDC. In case the list of the members
has not been furnished, the Association will furnish the list of
members both to the DSIDC as well as to the DGC within one
month from today.
The associations will also pay the
proportionate court fee @ Rs.50/- for each of the member of the
Association.
With these directions, the applications stands
disposed of.''
The order dated 17.10.2002 has to be seen in the context of the above

circumstances. It is no doubt true that the order explicitly states at two places that allottees
who paid 50% of the estimated cost by 31st March, 2001 but fell in default could make the
payment of the 20% installment together with interest on or before 31.12.2002 and that
payment for next 20% installment by 31.12.2002 would be without interest.

However, this

order cannot be read in isolation of the previous order.
13.

The final judgment of the Court negatived the challenge made by the petitioners

to the revised costing and upheld the enhanced cost of Rs.4200/- per square metre. The
present petitions were preferred on 19.4.2004.
14.

While examining any complaint of discrimination, the court has to not only

focus itself on the basis of the alleged discrimination, but also be alive about all the

wpc-6447-49/2004

5 of 7

surrounding factors. Here these facts assume some importance and are as follows:(i)
The petitioners have not approached the Court along with
the others who challenged the costing in 2001.
( ii )
The petitioners no where alleged that interim
orders of the court regarding low payment of installments without
interest were made universally applicable and accepted by the
DSIDC as a modification of its earlier scheme, in all cases.
( iii )
The first order of this court in WP 7155/2001
consciously was made applicable only to the petitioners whose
names were supplied as members of the association.
( iv )
The writ petition ultimately failed; final judgment
was rendered on 31.3.2003.
15 .

The stipulation of a time schedule in the context of development of flats and

allotment is a significant factor.

It operates as a condition for payment of the prescribed

condition and also binds the allottee and a public agency if such stipulation are not prescribed,
the scheme itself would be rendered uneconomical; besides the public agency would be left
with unaccounted discretion to accept payment from some and revised from others. To avoid
such chaotic consequences these time contracts are built into such schemes. The stipulation
of payment of interest as a condition for accepting delayed installments is an mechanism for
enforcement of these conditions.

While the plea of

non-discrimination is no doubt an

unshakable value which every public agency has to comply, nevertheless its infraction will
have to be seen in context.

If the nature of the interm orders in the previous proceedings had

been consistently couched

in universal terms, undoubtedly the petitioners could have

succeeded.

Yet , the broad context can simply not be ignored now.

The order dated

24.8.2002 consciously confined its operation to the petitioners before the court and eventually
the final judgment negatived the plea of the writ petitioners on merits.

Besides these, one of

the most important factors, i. e., details of the total number of allottees who paid in time and

wpc-6447-49/2004

6 of 7

those who did not are not available with the court. In the absence of these, the allegation of
discrimination without any other foundational effect regarding the universal obligation of the
allottees under the previous order, relating to the burden of depositing interest cannot be
upheld.

It is not disputed that the petitioner had deposited the amounts without any interest

on 30.12.2002.

However, those were not accepted because they had not paid the interest

amounts. It is open to them to pay interest within a period of six weeks in case they have not
done so.
16.

The writ petition is dismissed but subject to the direction contained in the

preceding paragraph.
