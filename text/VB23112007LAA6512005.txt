T.S.THAKUR, J. (ORAL)
These appeals arise out of orders passed by the Additional
District Judge, Delhi in five different but connected references
under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act.

Since common

L.A. APP. No.651/2005 & Connec. matters

page 2 of 12

questions of fact and law arise for consideration, the appeals
were heard together and shall stand disposed of by this common
order.
2.

Different parcels of land belonging to appellants-land

owners in different khasra numbers of village Holambi Khurd,
Delhi were acquired by the Collector Land Acquisition for public
purposes of shifting of industrial units from the city of Delhi.
Award No.4/98-99 determined the compensation payable to the
land owners in respect of the land acquired from their
ownership

while

a

supplementary

award

No.4A/98-99

determined the compensation payable to them on account of
superstructures standing on the said land. Dissatisfied with the
amount of compensation held payable to them, the owners
sought references under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act
to the civil court for determination of just and fair compensation
payable for the property acquired from their possession. The
reference court framed one common issue in all the references
to the following effect:
“1. To what enhancement in compensation is
the petitioner entitled?
If so, to what
amount?”
3.

2. Relief.”
In support of their claim for enhancement, the owners

examined PW-1 Rohit Khurana, PW-2 Rajender Ram and PW-3
L.A. APP. No.651/2005 & Connec. matters

page 3 of 12

Anil Kumar Sharma apart from certain documents which were
marked in the course of their depositions. Upon appreciation of
the evidence assembled at the trial, the reference court came to
the conclusion that there was no justification for directing any
enhancement in the amount of compensation payable to the land
owners for the land acquired from their ownership.

Even in

regard to the superstructures standing on the land that was
acquired, the reference court accepted the determination of the
amount by the Land

Acquisition

Collector and came to the

conclusion that the said amount was just and proper, on the
basis of a report prepared by the Public Works Department as to
the value of the said structures. On those findings the reference
court turned down the claim for enhancement made by the
owners before it. The owners, it appears, had also made a claim
for payment of solatium on the amount of compensation
determined towards the value of the superstructures standing
on the land.

That claim too was examined by the reference

court and rejected relying upon the decision of the Supreme
Court in Ratan Kumar Tandon & Ors. v. State of U.P. (1997) 2
SCC 161.

The references were on those findings rejected in

toto. The present appeals as already noticed, call in question
the correctness of the said orders passed by the reference court.

Appearing for the appellants Mr.J.V. Rana submitted that

the appellants were not assailing the view taken by the
reference court insofar as the claim for enhancement of
compensation payable for the land and the superstructures were
concerned.

He urged the amounts determined by the Land

Acquisition Collector both in regard to the land as also the
superstructures standing on the same could be taken as having
been properly determined.

However, the appellants were

according to Mr.Rana entitled to recover further amount from
the respondents on account of statutory benefits like solatium
on

the

amount

of

compensation

determined

for

the

superstructures and the additional compensation in terms of
Section 23(1A) together with interest on the said amounts under
Section 34 from the date the possession of the property was
taken over till the date of actual payment. He urged that the
learned reference court fell in error in rejecting the claim made
by the appellants for payment of solatium and statutory benefits
and that the decision in Ratan Kumar Tandon's case relied upon
by the court below had no application whatsoever to the facts
and situation in the case in hand. He further submitted that
while determining the additional amount of compensation under
Section 23(1A) of the Act, the period during which earlier writ

L.A. APP. No.651/2005 & Connec. matters

page 5 of 12

petitions filed by the owners challenging their threatened
dispossession from the land in question without compliance with
the provisions of Section 17 of the Act remained pending could
not be excluded having regard to the fact that the proceedings
for the acquisition of the land had not been held up on account
of the said direction. He drew our attention to different interim
orders passed by this court in the said petitions some of which
were to the following effect:
“Counsel for respondent No.3 submits that in
the facts of the present case the DSIDC is a
necessary party. Counsel for petitioner has
no objection to the DSIDC being impleaded as
a respondent.
Accordingly, DSIDC is
impleaded as respondent No.6 in this
petition. Amended memo of parties be filed
within a week. Let notice of this petition
issue to the DSIDC, Bombay Life Building, N
Block, Connaught Place, New Delhi for 13th
February, 1998. Petitioner will take steps to
serve the notice on DSIDC for the next date.
Counsel for respondents request for
time to file reply. Let the same be filed within
four weeks. Rejoinder, if any, be filed before
the next date.
In the meanwhile the
respondents will not dispossess the petitioner
except after complying with provisions of
section 17 of the Land Acquisition Act.
Copies of the order be given dasti to
counsel for the parties.”
5.

Mr. Rana urged that since the directions issued by this

court were meant to enforce compliance with Section 17 of the
Act, there was no real impediment in the progress of the

L.A. APP. No.651/2005 & Connec. matters

page 6 of 12

acquisition proceedings within the meaning of the explanation
to Section 23(1A) of the Land Acquisition Act so as to justify
exclusion of the period during which the said order remained in
force for purposes of grant of benefit under the said provision.
6.

We find considerable merits in both the submissions made

by Mr.Rana. In the light of the statement made by Mr.Rana that
the appellants are satisfied with the amount of compensation
determined towards the land and the superstructures, we are
not called upon to examine the correctness of the order passed
by the learned reference court in that regard. The only question
that remains to be examined is whether the appellants were
entitled to claim statutory benefits like additional compensation,
solatium and interest in terms of Section 23(1A) and 23(2) and
Section 34 of the Land Acquisition Act.
while

declining

to

award

solatium

The reference court
on

the

amount

of

compensation determined for the superstructures relied upon
the decision of the Supreme Court in Ratan Tandon's case,
supra.

That decision does not, however, lays down any

proposition like the one which the court below has read in the
same. All that the Supreme Court has observed in Ratan Kumar
Tandon's case is that when land and building are acquired by a
notification, the claimant is not entitled to separate valuation of

L.A. APP. No.651/2005 & Connec. matters

page 7 of 12

the building and the land. They are entitled to compensation on
either of the two methods but not both.

The court was in that

case dealing with a situation where the land had been
separately valued and, therefore, the building could not be
valued

again

or

separately

assessed

for

purposes

compensation except to the extent of value of the debris.
is precisely the position in the instant case also.

of

That

It is not

disputed that award No.4/98-99 had assessed the entire land
acquired from the ownership of the appellants including that
lying under the superstructures.

The supplementary award

thereafter made by the Collector assessed the superstructures
or debris without assessing the land underlying the building
again.

There was, therefore, no flaw in the process of

assessment made by the Collector. The Supreme Court was not,
it is obvious from a plain reading of the decision in Ratan Kumar
Tandon's case, dealing with the question whether the owner
would be entitled to solatium and additional compensation in
terms of Section 23(1A) of the Act even qua the value of the
debris.

The reference court, therefore, fell in error in rejecting

the claim for payment of solatium as also the additional
compensation

under

Section

23(1A)

merely

because

the

compensation in question related to the debris and not land as

L.A. APP. No.651/2005 & Connec. matters

page 8 of 12

understood in common parlance.

By doing so, the reference

court overlooked the definition of the term 'land' as given in
Section 3(a) of the Act. That expression is defined as under:
“3(a)- the expression “land” includes benefits
to arise out of land and things attached to the
earth or permanently fastened to anything
attached to the earth”
7.

It is not in dispute that even when the superstructure may

be valued as debris the same was permanently attached to
earth.

For purposes of valuation it can be treated as debris but

the fact remains that when the compensation for the entire
property is assessed the value of the land would represent the
true value of the property only if the value of the debris
standing on the same is also included. In that sense, therefore,
it was the sum total of the value of the land as also the debris
standing on the same which would constitute the compensation
payable to the land owners.

If that be so as indeed, it is in our

opinion, the owners would be entitled to statutory benefits of
additional compensation payable in terms of Section 23(1A) of
the Act and solatium in terms of Section 23(2) on the value of
debris also.

Inasmuch as Collector as also the reference court

declined payment of those benefits and interest on the same to
the owners they committed a mistake which needs to be
corrected in appeal.

That brings us to the question whether the proceedings in

the connected writ petitions had held up, the acquisition
proceedings within the meaning of explanation to Section
23(1A) so as to justify exclusion of the period for purposes of
calculation of benefit under Section 23(1A) of the Act. Learned
counsel for the appellants argued that the writ petitions filed by
the appellants simply intended to enforce the provisions of
Section 17(3A) of the Land Acquisition Act which envisaged
payment of 80% of amount before taking over the possession of
the land in question.

He drew our attention to some orders

passed in those proceedings from a reading whereof it does
appear that the court had simply insisted upon compliance with
the

requirements

of

Section

17

before

the

owners

are

dispossessed. Mr.Poddar, learned counsel for the respondent,
however, pointed out an order passed on 3rd September, 1997 in
W.P. (C) No.2697/1997 where the stay of dispossession is
unconditional. It was argued by Mr.Poddar that the language of
the orders issued by this Court in the writ petitions filed by the
appellants were different and, therefore, each case will have to
be seen in the context of the order that was passed.
9.

We do not consider it necessary to examine in detail the

submissions made at the Bar insofar as the question of exclusion

L.A. APP. No.651/2005 & Connec. matters

page 10 of 12

of the period from reckoning for purposes of Section 23(1A) is
concerned.

We say so because the orders passed by the writ

court shall have to be interpreted which process cannot be
undertaken by us without the complete writ records before us.
That apart the question whether any period requires to be
excluded in terms of the explanation, may more logically arise
for consideration before the executing court. All that we need
say is that the appellants would be entitled to the benefit of
Section 23(1A) subject to the explanation to the said provision.
Appellants will also be entitled for the benefit of the statutory
interest payable under Section 34 of the Act at the rate of 9%
for the first year and 15% for the subsequent period beyond one
year from the date of possession, not only in relation to the
compensation determined for the land but also for the amount of
compensation payable for the superstructure and the solatium
and additional compensation in terms of the decision of the
Supreme Court in Sunder v. Union of India 93 (2001) DLT 569.
10.

In the result, we allow these appeals but only in part and

to the limited extent that the appellants shall be entitled to
additional compensation in terms of Section 23(1A) and solatium
in terms of Section 23(2) as also interest on the said amounts
both in relation to the compensation determined for the land

L.A. APP. No.651/2005 & Connec. matters

page 11 of 12

and

that

held

payable

for

the

superstructures.

The

decrees/awards made by the reference court shall to that extent
stand modified. Parties are left to bear their own costs.
