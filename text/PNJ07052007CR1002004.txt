1.

Petitioners

are

aggrieved

by

the

order

dated

11.11.2003 passed by the learned Trial Judge dismissing their
application under Order 22 Rule 10 of the Code of Civil
Procedure.

CR.P.No.100/04

page 1 of 6

2.

In brief, petitioners claimed assignment under the

original plaintiffs and therefore prayed leave of the court to be
substituted as plaintiffs.
3.

Relevant facts to be noted for adjudicating the claim

of the petitioners are that Late Pandit Durga Dass was blessed
with 4 children namely Badri Prasad, Dharma Nand, Lalita Devi
and Rekha.
4.

On his demise, a dispute has arisen pertaining to

property no. 368-373, Kucha Ghasi Ram, Chandni Chowk, Delhi.
The two daughters namely Lalita Devi and Rekha claim 25%
share each on the ground that the property referred to
hereinbefore was the self acquired property of their father.
They claim that he bequeathed the same under a will to all four
children.
5.

The two sisters have filed a suit for injunction

against their brothers impleading their mother as a party. They
allege that their mother and brothers are threatening to sell the
suit property.
6.

During the pendency of the suit it appears that the

two brothers have executed certain sale deeds on behalf of self
and even their sisters, recording in the sale deeds that the
sisters have executed a power of attorney in their favour.
CR.P.No.100/04

page 2 of 6

7.

Petitioner No.1, Gauri Shankar is a tenant in a part

of the suit property. So is the status of petitioner no.2, Smt.
Sona Thakur.
8.

It is not in dispute that Lalita Devi and Rekha had

executed a power of attorney in favour of petitioner No.1
constituting him as their attorney in the civil suit filed by them
against their brothers and their mother.
9.

Gauri

Shankar

claims

that

acting

under

the

authorization issued in his favour by Lalita Devi, he has been
empowered to deal with Lalita Devi's share in the property. He
further states that on 7.7.1983, Lalita Devi executed a
registered sale deed in his favour pertaining to her 1/4th
undivided share in the suit property.
10.

Likewise, Smt. Sona Thakur claims that vide sale

deed dated 18.7.1983 Rekha has sold her 1/4th undivided
share to her i.e. Smt. Sona Thakur.
11.

Before the learned Trial Judge, Rekha Sharma

opposed the application stating that Gauri Shankar was
appointed as an attorney to prosecute the suit on her behalf
and that he has committed breach of trust.

She has denied

executing any sale deed in favour of any third party.
12.

In another proceedings, the two sisters admitted

CR.P.No.100/04

page 3 of 6

that they have sold their 1/4th share each in favour of their
brothers.
13.

In the backdrop of the aforenoted facts, learned Trial

Judge has declined to substitute the petitioners as plaintiffs in
place of the two sisters i.e. Lalita Devi and Rekha.
14.

Learned counsel for the petitioner states that

notwithstanding the stand taken by Lalita Devi and Rekha,
admittedly sale deeds stand registered in favour of the
petitioners and therefore interest of the petitioners would be
affected by any adjudication in the suit filed by Lalita Devi and
Rekha. Counsel urged that unless petitioners are brought on
record, they would not be able to counter the stand taken by
Lalita Devi and Rekha.
15.

A perusal of Sub Rule 1 of Rule 10 of Order 22

reveals that it is an enabling rule.
16.

The rule empowers a successor in interest, if he so

elects, to ask for and obtain leave of the court to continue with
the suit.
17.

But, the sine qua non for said right would be an

acceptance by a litigating party that it has transferred or
assigned its interest to the applicant.
18.

Where the assignment is questioned by the so called

CR.P.No.100/04

page 4 of 6

assignor, the person claiming to be the assignee cannot be
brought on record for the simple reason, as in the instant case,
the complexion of the dispute would get changed.
19.

The

legal

position

could

be

appreciated

with

reference to the facts of the instant case.
20.

Dispute is between two sisters on the one side and

their brothers and mother on the other.

The sisters claim a

right in the suit property alleging that their father, who
acquired the property by his labour, had bequeathed 1/4th
share each to the two sisters. This claim is being opposed by
the brothers and the mother. During pendency of the suit, the
brothers have executed a sale deed and claim that their sisters
authorized them to do so. The dispute between the brothers
and the sisters requires limited adjudication, whether the
property was bequeathed by the father as alleged or not. By
allowing impleadment of the petitioners, since the two sisters
deny having sold their share to the petitioners, the dispute
which would require adjudication would be whether the two
sisters sold their share to the petitioners and whether petitioner
no.1 breached the trust and confidence under which the power
of attorney was executed by the two sisters in his favour.
21.

Petitioners are strangers to the family of the original

CR.P.No.100/04

page 5 of 6

litigating parties. The original litigating parties were fighting on
the issue of succession. Petitioners claim a title to the property
predicating a claim on sale deeds executed by the two sisters
in their favour. Petitioners have an independent cause to seek
partition of the property, predicating a claim on the sale deeds
purportedly executed by the two sisters in their favour.
22.

The petition is accordingly dismissed.

23.

No costs.
