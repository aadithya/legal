JUDGMENT
Per Thakur, J(oral)
CM No. 6390/2008 (For Exemption)
Heard. Allowed, subject to all just exceptions.
The application is disposed of.
RFA No. 176/2008
This appeal arises out of a judgment and decree passed by the
Court of Additional District Judge, Delhi whereby Suit No. 173/2007 for

RFA No. 176/2008

possession of premises No.19/5 Shakti Nagar, Delhi has been decreed in
favour of the plaintiff/respondent.
When the appeal appeared before us on 8th may, 2008 learned
counsel for the appellant after arguing the matter at some length
submitted that the appellant was ready to vacate the premises in his
occupation provided he is given 1½ years’ time to do so. Learned counsel
for the respondent was not, however, agreeable to the grant of only six
months’ time to the appellant that too upon payment of the arrears of
compensation for use and occupation as also future payments on that
account.

Since, we saw an element of a settlement in the appeal, we

directed the parties to remain present in persons today.
has not, however, appeared despite that direction.

The appellant

Mr. Arya, counsel

appearing for him submits that the appellant is indisposed and is,
therefore, unable to appear in person.

He, however, has made a

statement which we have separately recorded, in which, Mr. Arya has on
the instructions of the appellant expressed his readiness to vacate the
premises in his occupation by the 31st May, 2009. Mr. Arya submits that
the judgment and decree passed by the Trial Court could be upheld and
the appellant may be given time till 31st May, 2009 to vacate the
premises.
The respondent, who is also present in person, has also made a
statement separately recorded by us, in which, he has agreed to the grant
of one year’s time provided the appellant pays compensation of Rs.4,500/per month for the period commencing from 1st May, 2008 till 31st May,

2009 which payment would remain subject to any enhancement that the
Trial Court may grant in the proceedings pending before it.

The

respondent also insists on the appellant filing an undertaking in this court
to the effect that he shall vacate the premises on his own on or before 31 st
May, 2009 without putting to the respondent trouble in executing the
decree.
In the circumstances, therefore, there is no need for us to examine
the contentions that were sought to be urged by the appellant in the
present appeal, no matter the said contentions were limited to the legality
of the notice issued by the respondent.

Be that as it may, since the

appellant is agreeable to the judgment and decree impugned in the
appeal being upheld and his prayer is limited only to the grant of time to
vacate the premises, it is unnecessary for us to examine the question of
validity of the notice. We, accordingly, affirm the judgment and decree
under challenge and grant one year’s time ending 31st May, 2009 to the
appellant to vacate the premises subject to the following conditions:(1)

The appellant files in this Court an undertaking to the effect that he

shall vacate the entire suit premises comprising 3rd and 4th floor of the
building, in question, voluntarily and without any later hindrance on or
before the 31st May, 2009.

The undertaking shall be filed within four

weeks from today.
(2)

The appellant pays on a regular basis Rs.4,500/- per month towards

compensation for use and occupation of the premises in question,
commencing from 1st May, 2008 till 31st May, 2009 or any earlier date
RFA No. 176/2008

when the premises is vacated. The payment shall be made by the 10th of
every succeeding calendar month by making a deposit in the Trial Court.
The Trial Court shall disburse the payment to the respondent on an
application filed in that regard. Default in payment by the appellant, shall
render the decree passed by the Trial Court affirmed by this Court
executable forthwith.
A copy of the order be given dasti to both the parties.
