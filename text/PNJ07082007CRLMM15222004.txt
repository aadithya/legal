Vide Crl.M.C. No.1522/2004 petitioner challenges her
Page 1 of 4

being summoned by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate, New
Delhi to face a charge under Section 347/461 of the DMC Act
1957 pursuant to a criminal complaint lodged by the Municipal
Corporation of Delhi.
2.

The complaint relates to an alleged misuse of the

basement of the property No.R-75, Greater Kailash, Part-I, New
Delhi.
3.

In

Crl.M.C.

No.1526/2004,

petitioner

challenges

another similar order summoning her to face a similar charge
pertaining to a property No.11/1-B, Pusa Road, New Delhi.
4.

In the complaint forming subject matter of Crl.M.C.

No.1522/2004, it is inter alia alleged that M/s.VLCC Beauty Care
Centre of which petitioner was the manager/in-charge was
found misusing the property. In the complaint forming subject
matter of Crl.M.C. No.1526/2004 it was stated that the
petitioner as proprietor of M/s.VLCC Beauty Care Centre was
misusing said property.
5.

On what basis was it alleged that the petitioner was

the manager/in-charge of M/s.VLCC Beauty Care Centre or on
what basis it was being alleged that the petitioner was the
owner/occupier of the property at Pusa Road had not been
stated anywhere in the respective petitions.
6.

I need not deal with

the

nitty

gritties

of

the

issues
Page 2 of 4
urged in the 2 petitions for the simple reason it is not disputed
by learned counsel for the MCD that qua property No.R-75,
Greater Kailash, Part-I, New Delhi by and under a franchise
agreement dated 5.4.2002 M/s.Curls and Curves India Ltd., a
company

incorporated

under

the

Companies

Act

have

authorized Smt.Seema Virmani and Smt.Leela Sethi to operate
as a franchise, a beauty and slimming centre from said
premises using the name of Curls and Curves.

It is thus

apparent that the slimming, beauty and fitness centre was
being run and managed by Seema Virmani and Leela Sethi.
7.

Assuming that the franchise agreement was a smoke

screen, in said eventuality the user would be by M/s.Curls and
Curves India Ltd.
8.

It is not the case of the MCD that the petitioner was

in-charge of the affairs of said company pertaining to the
premises in question.
9.

Similarly, pertaining to the property at Pusa Road, Jai

Baba Associates, a partnership firm of Manpreet Singh Arora
and Sukhmeet Singh Arora have been authorized by M/s.Curles
and Curves India Ltd. to operate a beauty and slimming health
centre from said place as franchise under M/s.Curls and Curves

India Ltd.
10.

Question

of

the

petitioner

being

the

owner/occupier
Page 3 of 4
in her own right does not arise.
11.

Both petitions stand disposed of quashing the

summoning order summoning the petitioner to face trial in the
respective 2 complaints.
12.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti by the Registry

to learned counsel for the petitioner on payment of usual
charges.

employee.

Petitioner had employed late Mohan Lal as its
Alleging

that during

course of employment

petitioner had given possession of a residential quarter to
Mohan Lal who had not returned possession thereof on
retirement, a complaint under Section 630 of the Companies
Act 1956 was filed before the learned Metropolitan Magistrate,
Delhi.
2.

Mohan Lal died during pendency of the complaint.

Petitioner's application to bring on record his legal heirs was

Page 1 of 4
dismissed by the learned ACMM vide order dated 23.8.2003.
3.

Petitioner's Crl.Rev.No.23/2004 was dismissed by

the learned Additional Sessions Judge vide order dated
2.11.2003.
4.

Petitioner has challenged both orders with a prayer

that application filed by the petitioner to bring on record legal
heirs of late Mohan Lal be allowed.
5.

Reason given by the Courts below is that with the

death of Mohan Lal a fresh cause of action has accrued to the
petitioner to institute fresh proceedings against the legal heirs
of the deceased employee.
6.

I am afraid, learned ACMM and the learned ASJ have

not correctly understood the legal provision enshrined in the
Companies Act 1956 namely Section 630 thereof.
7.

Wrongfully obtaining possession of the property of a

company or wrongfully withholding it or knowingly applying it
to a purpose other than that authorized by the company makes
the employee liable for punishment under Section 630 of the
Companies Act. The object is to not only regulate the affairs of
a company but to protect the property of the company.
8.

It is for said reason that Section 630 of the

Companies Act 1956 has been interpreted to mean that the

offence contemplated thereunder is a continuing offence.
9.

In the report published as 1995 RLR 232 (SC)
Page 2 of 4

Smt.Abhilasha V.K.Jain vs. Cox & Kings, in para 17 the Supreme
Court observed:-

10.

“17. S.630 of the Act provides speedy relief to the
company where its property is wrongfully obtained or
wrongfully withheld by an “employee or an officer” or a
“past employee or an officer” or “legal heirs and
representatives” deriving their colour and content from
such an “employee or officer” in so far as the
occupation and possession of the property belonging
to the company is concerned. The failure to deliver
property back to the employer on the termination,
resignation, superannuation or death of an employee,
would render the “holding” of that property wrongful
and actionable u/S.630 of the Act. To hold that the
“legal heirs” would not be covered by S.630 of the Act
would be unrealistic and illogical. It would defeat the
“beneficent” provision and ignore, the factual realities
that the legal heirs of the family members who are
continuing in possession of the allotted property, had
obtained the right of occupancy with the concerned
employee in the property of the employer only by
virtue of their relationship with the employee/officer
and had not obtained or acquired the right to
possession of the property in any other capacity, status
or right.”
Whether legal heirs of the deceased employee have

to be made accountable by and under a separate petition or
can be impleaded as legal heirs in the existing petition? Let me
put a poser.
11.

If the employee, during the pendency of the

prosecution dies, can it reasonably be said that the prosecution

under Section 630 abates?
negative.

The answer has to be in the

The reason is that if the property of the company

was wrongly held by the employee, its

possession

by

his

heirs and
Page 3 of 4
legal representatives would be equally wrongful. Inasmuch as
the employee was liable to return the same, said heirs or legal
representatives who come into possession thereof would be
equally liable.

As long as the liability remains, cause would

survive in favour of the company.
12.

The petition accordingly is allowed. Impugned order

dated 28.11.2003 dismissing Crl.Rev. No.23/2004 is set aside.
The revision petition is allowed. As a consequence thereof the
order dated 23.8.2003 passed by the learned ACMM, Delhi is
set aside. Application filed by the petitioner for impleadment of
the legal heirs of deceased Mohal Lal is allowed.
13.

Proceedings shall be revived by the learned ACMM

and after serving the legal heirs of deceased Mohan Lal further
proceedings would be conducted in accordance with law.
14.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti by the Registry

to learned counsel for the petitioner on payment of usual
charges.
