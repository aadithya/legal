PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

By above captioned petitions under Section 482 of

the Code of Criminal Procedure petitioner is seeking recall of 2
orders of

even date i.e. 6.8.2005 passed by the Court of

Special Judge, NDPS, Delhi.
2.

On 20.11.1987 Drug Enforcement Administration

Officials, USA seized narcotic drugs from 2 Indians and

Crl.M.C.4872/05 & 4855/05

page 1 of 10

informed Narcotics Control Bureau about the same.

On

22.6.1988 NCB, Delhi filed a complaint against 6 persons
including petitioner under Section 21, 23 and 29 of the NDPS
Act, 1985.
3.

Facts pertaining to Crl.M.C. 4872/2005 are that on

18.5.2005 an application was moved by the petitioner seeking
permission to inspect the file brought by Devender Dutt, PW-6.
The file was sought for cross-examining said witness.
4.

Vide impugned order dated 6.8.05, application of the

petitioner was dismissed by the Special Judge
5.

It is not in dispute that file in question relates to

investigation conducted by the official of the respondent NCB in
connection with commission of the alleged offence.
6.

Learned counsel for the petitioner had raised a two-

fold contention in support of his petition.
(i)

That right to information is a fundamental right
under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India
save

and

except

confidential

documents

as

mentioned under Section 123 of the Indian Evidence
Act. That since respondent NCB has not claimed any
such protection under Section 123, petitioner is
entitled to inspect the file.
Crl.M.C.4872/05 & 4855/05

page 2 of 10

(ii)

That learned Special Judge failed to appreciate that
file was required by the petitioner to prepare his
defence. Therefore, denial of the respondent NCB to
provide access to the said file to the petitioner is a
violation of principles of natural justice and contrary
to Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution of India.

7.

Per contra, learned counsel for the respondent

contended

that

petitioner

cannot

claim

inspection

of

investigation of file as a matter of right.
8.

Respondent draws attention of this court to Section

172 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which reads as under :“172.
Diary
of
proceeding
in
investigation – (1) Every police officer making
an investigation under this Chapter shall day by
day enter his proceeding in the investigation in a
diary, setting forth the time at which the
information reached him, the time at which he
began and closed his investigation, the place or
places visited by him, and a statement of the
circumstances
ascertained
through
his
investigation.
(2) Any Criminal Court may send fro the police
diaries of a case under inquiry or trial in such
Court, and may use such diaries, not as evidence
in the case, but to aid it in such inquiry or trial.
(3) Neither the accused nor his agents shall be
entitled to call for such diaries, nor shall he or
they be entitled to see them merely because they
Crl.M.C.4872/05 & 4855/05

page 3 of 10

9.

are referred to by the Court; but, if they are used
by the policed officer who made them to refresh
his memory, or if the Court uses them for the
purpose of contradicting such police officer, the
provisions of section 161 or section 145, as the
case may be, of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (1
of 1872), shall apply.
A plain reading of Section 172(3) makes it obvious

that an accused is not entitled to see record of investigation
maintained by a police officer except for the limited purposes of
Section 145 and Section 161 of the Indian Evidence Act,1872.
10.

The key question that arises for consideration in

present case is whether provisions of Code of Criminal
Procedure can be availed of for investigating, inquiring or trying
of offences under any law other than Indian Penal Code.
11.

To answer this question, it is necessary to note

Section 4 and 5 of Code of Criminal Procedure.
“4. Trial of offences under the Indian
Penal Code and other laws – (1) All offences
under the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) shall
be investigated, inquired into, tried, and
otherwise dealt with according to the provisions
hereinafter contained.
(2) All offences under any other law shall be
investigated, inquired into, tried and otherwise
dealt with according to the same provision, but
subject to any enactment fro the time being in
force regulating the manner or place of
investigating, inquiring into, trying or otherwise
dealing with such offences.
5.

Saving – Nothing contained in this Code

Crl.M.C.4872/05 & 4855/05

page 4 of 10

12.

shall, in the absence of a specific provision to
the contrary, affect any special or local law fro
the time being in force, or any special
jurisdiction or power conferred, or any special
form of procedure prescribed, by any other law
fro the time being in force.”
In A. R. Antulay Vs. Ramdas Sriniwas Nayak AIR

1984 SC 718, a Constitution Bench of Supreme Court while
examining the similar questions with regard to applicability of
Section 4 with reference to the Prevention of Corruption Act has
laid down the law as under :-

13.

“In the absence of a specific provision made in
the statute indicating that offences will have to
be investigated, inquired into, tried and
otherwise dealt with according to that statute,
the same will have to be investigated, inquired
into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to
the Criminal P.C. In other words, Criminal P. C. is
the
parent
statute
which
provides
for
investigation, inquiring into and trial of cases by
criminal Courts of various designations.”
In the decision reported as Directorate

of

Enforcement Vs. Deepak Mahajan & Anr. AIR 1994 SC 1775,
Supreme Court was again concerned with the question whether
provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure would be applicable to
special laws, particularly FERA and Customs Act. In paras 121,
127 and 132 It was observed as under :“121.
Section 4(2) of the Code corresponds to
Section 5(2) of the old Code. Section 26(b) of the
Code corresponds to Section 29 of the old Code
except for a slight change. Under the present
Section 26(b) any offence under any other law shall,
Crl.M.C.4872/05 & 4855/05

page 5 of 10

when any Court is mentioned in this behalf in such
law, be tried by such Court and when no Court is
mentioned in this behalf, may be tried by the High
Court or other court by which such offence is shown
in the First Schedule to be triable. The combined
operation of Sections 4(2) and 26(b) of the Code is
that the offence complained of should be
investigated or inquired into or tried according to
the provisions of the Code where the enactment
which creates the offence, indicates no special
procedure.

127.
To sum up Section 4 is comprehensive
and that Section 5 is not in derogation of Section 4
(2) and it only relates tot he extent of application of
the Code in the matter of territorial and other
jurisdiction but does not nullify the effect of Section
4(2). In short, the provisions of this Code would be
applicable to the extent in the absence of any
contrary provision in the special Act or any special
provision excluding the jurisdiction or applicability
of the Code. In fact, the second limb of Section 4(2)
itself limits the application of the provisions of the
Code reading, “........... but subject to any
enactment for the time being in force regulating the
manner or place of investigating, inquiring into,
trying or otherwise dealing with such offences.

132.
For the aforementioned reasons, we hold
that the operation of Section 4(2) of the Code is
straightway attracted to the area of investigation,
inquiry and trial of the offences under the special
laws including the FERA and Customs Act and
consequently S. 167 of the Code can be made
applicable during the investigation or inquiry of an
offence under the special Acts also inasmuch as
there is no specific provision contrary to that
excluding the operation of Section 167.”

Crl.M.C.4872/05 & 4855/05

14.

From the aforenoted judicial decisions, the ratio

which emerges is that provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure
shall apply during course of investigation, inquiry or trial of an
offence under special laws which must of necessity include
NDPS Act 1985.

Consequently Section 172 Cr.P.C. shall also

apply during investigation or inquiry of an offence under NDPS
Act inasmuch as there is no specific provision in the NDPS Act
contrary to or excluding the operation of Section 172.
15.

For the aforementioned reasons, I thus hold that

learned special Judge has rightly held that the petitioner is not
entitled to inspect the investigation file of the case as subsection (3) of Section 172 prohibits the same.
16.

Crl.M.C. 4872/2005 is accordingly dismissed.

17.

Facts pertaining to Crl.M.C. 4855/2005 are that

during

the

course

of

investigation,

Mr.S.K.Sharma, a Handwriting

NCB

had

sent

to

Expert, certain documents

which contained the admitted signatures of petitioner as also
an original application dated 22.11.1987 written by petitioner
in his own hand to the Deputy Director of NCB to compare the
handwritings therein with the handwritings on the documents
recovered from the residence of Jasbir

Singh and give his

opinion whether all the writings are of the same person. On
Crl.M.C.4872/05 & 4855/05

page 7 of 10

7.12.1987, Mr.S.K.Sharma, Handwriting Expert submitted the
opinion report.
18.

During

the

course

of

trial,

Mr.S.K.Sharma,

Handwriting Expert died.
19.

On 28.1.2005, an application was filed by the NCB

before the Special Judge, inter alia, praying that NCB be
permitted to examiner another expert as their witness and
petitioner be directed to give his specimen handwriting sample
having the words and figures which occur in Exs.PW5/A, PW5/B,
PW5/E and PW5/G and also the words and figures occurring in
application dated 22.11.1987.
20.

Vide order dated 6.8.2005, learned Special Judge

allowed the application.
21.

Learned counsel for the petitioner contended that

NCB had filed application in question with a view to delay the
trial of the case that learned Special Judge failed to appreciate
that prosecution was launched in the year 1988 and that
application in question has been filed after a lapse of 18 years.
Thus, considering that speedy trial is a facet of Article 21 of the
Constitution of India and noting the conduct of prosecution,
learned Special Judge ought to have rejected the application of
the NCB.
Crl.M.C.4872/05 & 4855/05

page 8 of 10

22.

Indian Evidence Act recognizes 2 direct methods of

proving the handwriting of a person :(i)

By an admission of the person who wrote it.

(ii)

By the evidence of a witness who has seen a person
writing a document.

23.

These

are

the

best

methods

of

proof

of

a

handwriting. These apart, there are 3 other modes of proof by
opinion. They are :(i)

By evidence of a handwriting expert (Section 45)

(ii)

By the evidence of a witness acquainted with
handwriting of a person who is said to have written
the writing in question. (Section 47)

(iii)

Opinion formed by the court on comparison made by
itself. (Section 73)

24.

In the instant case, prosecution sought to prove

handwriting of petitioner by evidence of a handwriting expert.
Specimen handwriting of petitioner was obtained. After making
comparison, handwriting expert submitted his opinion.
25.

Before evidentiary value can be attached to the said

opinion, it is essential that handwriting expert steps into the
witness box and proves the said opinion.
26.

Considering that handwriting expert has died, his

Crl.M.C.4872/05 & 4855/05

page 9 of 10

opinion cannot be proved by his testimony. The opinion being
personal in nature, there can also be no secondary evidence of
the same. Therefore, the prosecution has no option but to send
specimen handwriting of the petitioner to another handwriting
expert for fresh comparison.
27.

Considering that earlier specimen handwriting which

was obtained by the prosecution has been lost, It is logical that
prosecution will have to obtain fresh specimen handwriting of
the petitioner.
28.

The facts and circumstances of the case as noted by

me do not suggest that prosecution, i.e. NCB had filed the
application in question to delay the trial of the case.
29.

I find no infirmity in the impugned order.

30.

Crl.M.C. 4855/2005 is also dismissed.

31.

No costs.
