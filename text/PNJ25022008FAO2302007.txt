1.

Ram

Singh,

husband

of

respondent

No.1

in

FAO.No.230/2007 and father of respondents 2 to 5 and Ram
Kumar, husband of respondent No.1 in FAO.No.231/2007 and
father of respondents 2 to 5 in said appeal were admittedly
FAO No.230/07

page 1 of 6

employees of the appellant.

The two were scavengers and

used to perform the duties of sweeping and cleaning the
properties of the appellant.
2.

10.6.2002 was an unfortunate date in their lives.

A

sewer line belonging to NDMC but servicing the apartments
owned by the appellant got choked. The

service line had to

be flushed for the reason domestic sewage including human
excreta was not being flushed from the toilets in the buildings
owned by the appellants or if flushed, was overflowing

within

the precincts of the complex.
3.

Ram Kumar and Ram Singh were made to clear and

clean the sewer line. Without proper gear and tools or safety
equipment, when the two entered the sewer line for flushing
the same to remove

the obstruction,

both died inside the

sewer line due to toxic gases having accumulated inside the
sewer line.

The two inhaled the toxic gases.

They were

brought dead at RML Hospital.
4.

Their wife and children filed claim petitions before

the Commissioner Workmen Compensation. The employment
under the appellant was not in dispute. Their age was not in
dispute. Their wages were not in dispute. Only issue raised by
the appellants was that both the workmen
alcohol

and they were

FAO No.230/07

had consumed

not supposed to consume alcohol
page 2 of 6

when on duty.

It was urged that had they not consumed

alcohol, the two would not have lost consciousness when they
encountered the toxic gases.
5.

By and under the two identically worded orders

dated 21.5.2007 and 22.5.2007 the Commissioner Workmen
Compensation allowed the claim petitions.
6.

The defense of the workmen having consumed

alcohol has been repelled on the ground that the management
ought not to have allowed the workmen to have performed
duties if both were drunk.
7.

It is urged by the learned counsel for the appellant

that it is not in the control of the management if workers are
drunk.

With reference to the postmortem report it is urged

that the same reflects alcohol in the blood of the workmen.
8.

The contention has to be repelled for the reason,

firstly, there is no evidence that the level of intoxication of the
workmen was so high that the two could not have realized
that they were inhaling toxic gases.

But I have more

fundamental reasons to repell the plea.
9.

Scavengers who clean sewer lines are persons

belonging to the most under privileged strata of the society.
10.

Judicial experience of this court (as a citizen) reveals

that sewer line cleaners work in sub human condition without
FAO No.230/07

page 3 of 6

any protective gear; with bare bodies, just a loin cloth
wrapped around the loins, these humble persons perform the
dirty job of removing the muck from choked sewer lines with
their bare hands.
11.

Even to a lay man it is evident that toxic gases do

accumulate in sewer line. Indeed, as per law, sewer lines have
ventilating chimnies to enable toxic gases to escape.
12.

Methane gas being produced by human excreta is a

scientific reality. That methane gas is toxic and is odourless is
also a scientific reality.

Thus,

the management of the

appellant ought to have kept ready a methane gas detector.
There is no evidence that the management of the appellant did
so.
13.

On the plea of the deceased workmen being

intoxicated, I wonder whether a person who has not consumed
alcohol can at all bear the the stench of filth and excreta in a
choked sewer line?
14.

The appellant is clearly guilty of dereliction of duty

resulting in the death of the two innocent workmen.
15.

Thus, I find no merits in the first plea urged by the

learned counsel for the appellant.
16.

A second plea urged is that till compensation is

determined, question of the same being deposited does not
FAO No.230/07

page 4 of 6

arise and hence directions in the impugned orders to pay
interest @ 12% per annum from the date of claim petition till
realisation is liable to be set aside.
17.

Learned counsel for the parties cite decision dated

1.2.2007 of the Hon'ble Supreme Court disposing of Civil
Appeal

No.5623/2006,

National

Insurance

Company

Vs.

Mubasir Ahmad & Ors..
18.

The said decision

is clearly distinguishable.

It

related to injuries sustained to the workmen. It was debatable
on the facts of the said case as to what was the percentage
disability. In said context Hon'ble Supreme Court opined that
till, based on the percentage disability, compensation was
assessed, question of paying the same did not arise and hence
interest was made payable

with effect from the date

compensation was computed. In my opinion, both the cases
stand on an entirely different footing for the reason in case of
both, percentage disability determination is not required.
Based on the wages and the age of the deceases workmen,
applying

a

predetermined formula.
19.

I find no merits in the appeals.

20.

Pursuant to order dated 8.6.2007 appellant was

FAO No.230/07

page 5 of 6

directed to deposit 75% of the principle amount with the
Registrar General of this court. The said amount is directed to
be remitted to the Commissioner Workmen Compensation by
the Registrar of this court. Interest, if any, which has accrued
on the amount be also remitted.
21.

Needless to state, the Commissioner Workmen

Compensation shall disbursed the said amount as also would
recover further amount payable by the appellant and disburse
the same to the respondents.
22.

Since the respondents have chosen not to contest

the instant appeals, there shall be no order as to costs.
