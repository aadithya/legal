ORDER
01.04.2008

1. This is the fourth round of litigation filed by the petitioner. The petitioner
had earlier in 1984 filed a civil suit which was withdrawn. Another civil
suit was filed in 1988 which again was withdrawn. In 1989, the petitioner
filed the third civil suit. Copy of the plaint has been placed on record.
The petitioner claimed that he is in possession of Kitchen no.1, Barrack
no.7, in Block-B, Outram Lines, Kingsway Camp, Dehi-110009 and
another 9000 sq.fts of adjoining area out of which he has covered 2700
sq.fts since 1952. It was claimed that the petitioner’s possession was for
more than 30 years and the respondent authorities namely UOI and
DDA had no right to dispossess the petitioner. A decree for declaration

was prayed for, along with decree of permanent injunction.
2. In the written statement filed to the said suit, the respondent/DDA had
pointed out that the petitioner was an unauthorized occupant whose
case was examined by Committee in 1984 and he was held entitled to
allotment of 25 sq.yds of land. Before the Committee the petitioner
could not establish his status as a registered displaced person nor he
could produce documents to support his claim for allotment of 80 sq.yds
of plot. In the written statement it was pointed out that the petitioner’s
name did not appear in Survey list of 1967. The defence of DDA was
that the petitioner was a rank trespasser over the Government land and
was entitled to no relief.
3. The Civil Judge considered the evidence adduced by the parties in
respect of the pleadings and dismissed the said suit. The Civil Judge
specifically recorded that the petitioner herein in his statement had
admitted having received demolition slip in respect of 25 sq.yds of land.
The Civil Judge also recorded that the Allotment Committee had
examined the case of the petitioner in 1984, but did not find him eligible
for allotment of a 80 sq.yds. plot.
4. Appeal filed by the petitioner was dismissed by the Appellate Court vide
judgment dated 4.10.2007. The relevant findings given by the first
Appellate court are as under :

“
It is not disputed that the appellant before this court
was a displaced person from Pakistan and has started
living with his family in the plot in question but the plaintiff
was only allotted 25 sq.ft at Outer Lane, Kignsway Camp
whereas he had trespassed over the remaining portion of
the government land. The property in question had been
transferred by the Government to the DDA for redevelopment in the year 1982 and the case of the
plaintiff/appellant for the allotment of 80 sq.ft land had been
rejected by the committee vide recommendation dated
17.5.1983 which recommendation of the committee are
Ex.DW2/2 collectively. The demolition slip bearing no.5989
and 5990 had been issued to the appellant on 30.11.1976
for the allotment of 25 sq.yds land as per the policy of the
government and hence the appellant had been left with no
other claim.
In this background the averment made by the
appellant that he had been in uninterrupted possession of
the government land does not hold any merit and hence
being a rank trespasser he is liable to be evicted from the
premises in question by adopting due process of law.”

5. The petitioner thereafter, filed a second appeal, which too was
dismissed by this court on 14.12.2007 holding that no substantial
question of law arises. The second Appellate Court also noticed that
the petitioner was removed from the area in 1976, which had
encroached upon by the petitioner. The Court observed that evidence
probablises repeated trespass by the petitioner.
6. I do not think the petitioner should be allowed or permitted to repeatedly
raise the same issues again and again. Further, the petitioner is a rank
trespasser who has encroached upon government land. His claim has

been repeatedly rejected. There is no merit in the present writ petition.
Hence, the same is dismissed.
CM Nos.5126-27/2008
In view of the order passed in writ petition, the above said applications
do not survive and hence stand disposed of.
