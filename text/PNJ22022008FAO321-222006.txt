PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Matter was called for the first time at around 12:00

noon. At the passover round it has been called for the second
time at 1:00 PM. None appears for the respondent.
2.

The appellant is aggrieved by the fact that vide

impugned order dated 10.10.2006 their application under
Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC praying for a restraint order against
the defendants from creating third party interest in the suit
FAO No.321/06

page 1 of 5

property, pending adjudication of the suit has been dismissed.
3.

Appellants are the plaintiffs.

The defendants are

their mother and their bother.
4.

During the pendency of the present appeal the

mother expired. The three siblings, being already on record,
this fact was noted in the order dated 23.8.2007.
5.

Case of the appellants was that the suit property

bearing No.H-1491, C.R.Park, New Delhi was the property
acquired by their father Sh. G.N.Saha from ancestral funds.
The daughters claimed partition in view of the amended
provisions of the Hindu Succession Act.
6.

Defence was predicated by relying upon a will

stated to have been executed by Sh. G.N.Saha on 29.1.1999.
It was stated that the property was the self-acquired property
of Sh. G.N.Saha.
7.

Declining

injunction

learned

Trial

Judge

has

recorded, pertaining to the will, that on the face of it it appears
to be genuine.
8.

On the issue of source of funds, learned Trial Judge

has held that prima facie material evidence that G.N.Saha
acquired the property from his own funds.
9.

It is urged by learned counsel for the appellant that

Sh. G.N.Saha died on 1.2.1999. Counsel urges that this fact is
FAO No.321/06

page 2 of 5

itself sufficient to cast a serious doubt on the due execution of
the stated will dated 29.1.1999.

Counsel further urges that

there was documentary evidence placed before the Trial Judge
that a few days prior to his death, G.N.Saha being unwell, was
admitted in a hospital.
10.

Unfortunately, due to non representation from the

side of the respondents this court does not have the benefit of
the view of the respondent.
11.

Suffice would it be to state that at the interim stage

a court has to consider prima facie case and not to evaluate
evidence to return conclusive findings for the reason there is
no evidence strictly so called before the court.

Documents

placed before the court are to be proved in accordance with
law.

Witnesses of the parties have to testify and subject

themselves to cross examination.
12.

The circumstance of the will being dated 29.1.1999

and the deceased having died 2 days thereafter and the fact
that a few days prior to the execution of the will the deceased
was hospitalized, do prima facie cast a doubt whether the
deceased was in a testamentary state of mind on 29.1.1999.
13.

I fail to understand as to how a prima facie finding

pertaining to the authenticity of the will could be rendered by
recording that on the face of it the will appears to be genuine.

14.

Probably the learned Trial Judge has been guided by

his judicial experience of daughters being generally deprived
of immovable property in India.
15.

These kinds of presumptions cannot be generalized

for the reason this court has come across enlightening parents
who have given equal share of their wealth to their daughters.
16.

In a suit for partition the ordinary rule is to secure

the property to be available for partition if claim succeeds
unless there are compelling circumstances brought on record
justifying non grant of an interim injunction.

In the instant

case I find no circumstance brought out justifying departure
from the normal rule of granting interim injunctions.
17.

Appeal is allowed.

18.

Impugned order dated 10.10.2006 is set aside.

19.

Appellant's application under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2

CPC is allowed.
20.

It is directed that till suit filed by the appellants is

disposed of, the respondent would not transfer, alienate,
encumber or part with possession of the suit property bearing
municipal No. H-1491, C.R.Park, New Delhi. Noting that a part
of the suit property is tenanted, permitting respondent to
realize rent, I direct the respondent to maintain an account of
the rent realized and money spent on the upkeep of the
FAO No.321/06

page 4 of 5

property.

If the tenant vacates the tenanted premises said

fact would be disclosed to the learned Trial Judge.

Rent at

which new tenant is sought to be inducted would be indicated
and after taking permission of the court it would be permissible
for the respondent to induct a new tenant, but in respect of the
portion already in occupation of the tenant.
21.

When the order was concluded Sh. Sanjay Aggarwal

Advocate entered the court on behalf of the respondent.
22.

The contents of the order have been verbally told to

learned counsel for the respondent.
23.

No costs.
