Learned counsel for

was

that
not

impleaded as petitioner No.2 inasmuch as counsel for the
petitioners thought that as Karuna Bhatia had filed the petition on
behalf of Standard Chartered Bank, the petition would enure to
the benefit of Karuna Bhatia as well.
2.

Learned counsel for the petitioners concedes that the

belief of learned counsel for the petitioners is in sweet ignorance
of law.

3.

Suffice would it be to state that where a company and

the living human being stated to be in charge and control of the
affairs of the company are impleaded as accused persons, each is
an accused in its/his individual capacity and each must take
recourse to legal remedy available as per law.
4.

Be that as it may, amended memo of parties is taken

on record. Ms.Karuna Bhatia is impleaded as petitioner No.2.
5.

Petitioners are aggrieved by the fact that they have

been summoned to face trial in a complaint filed by respondent
No.2 under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881.
6.

First petitioner is Standard Chartered Bank.

Second

petitioner is Ms.Karuna Bhatia, Manager of its branch at Greater
Kailash Part-I.
7.

Basis of the complaint is the dishonour of a banker's

cheque dated 3.3.2003 drawn on first petitioner and issued by its
Manager i.e. petitioner No.2.
8.

M/s.A.D.Exports

Pvt.

Ltd.

had

an

account

petitioner No.1 at its branch at Greater Kailash Part-I.

with
On

30.1.2003, alleging that M/s.A.D.Exports Pvt. Ltd. was a defaulter,
in that, had not paid income tax dues to the income tax
authorities, tax recovery officer issued a warrant of attachment,
attaching the account of M/s.A.D.Exports Pvt. Ltd.
9.

The said notice was addressed to first petitioner at its

corporate office.
10.

On 11.2.2003, the tax recovery officer intimated

Crl.M.C. No.137/04

Page 2 of 5

petitioner No.1 that notwithstanding the attachment, no amount
was received by the income tax authorities. First petitioner was
advised

to

remit

the

money

lying

in

the

account

of

M/s.A.D.Exports Pvt. Ltd.
11.

Notwithstanding

the

attachment,

on

3.3.2003,

M/s.A.D.Exports Pvt. Ltd. got prepared a banker's cheque in sum
of Rs.4,86,000/- payable in favour of M/s.Omniplast Pvt. Ltd. and
handed over the pay order to said company.

The same was

issued by petitioner No.2.
12.

When presented for encashment, the cheque was

returned without being honoured vide return memo dated
12.3.2003 with the instructions 'Refer to Drawer'.
13.

M/s.Omniplast Pvt. Ltd. caused to be served upon the

petitioners a notice dated 24.3.2003 calling upon the noticee to
honour the cheque by making payment in sum of Rs.44,86,000/-.
14.

Aforesaid notice was replied by the petitioners on

7.3.2003

informing

that

the

banker's

cheque

was

issued

erroneously as the account of M/s.A.D.Exports Pvt. Ltd. had been
attached by the income tax authorities much prior to the date
when banker's cheque was issued.
15.

M/s.Omniplast Pvt. Ltd. filed a complaint under Section

138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, inter alia stating that once
the banker had debited the account of the client and had issued
the banker's cheque, liability to pay was taken over by the
banker, thus, it was prayed that action as per law be taken

Crl.M.C. No.137/04

Page 3 of 5

against the petitioners.
16.

As a proposition of law, it would be a correct statement

to make, that once a bankers debits the account of its customer
and issues either a bank draft or a banker's cheque and the said
negotiable instrument reaches the hands of the payee, when
presented for encashment, the bank has to honour the same.
17.

However where, as in the instant case, the banker's

cheque is issued after debiting the account of the customer but
after the account has been lawfully attached by an authority
competent to attach the account, issuance of the pay order being
the result of an oversight or a negligence, different issue would
arise for consideration; viz., whether the officers of the bank as
also the banker would be liable under the tort of negligence.
18.

A complaint under Section 138 of the Negotiable

Instruments Act 1881 is not founded on the tort of negligence.
19.

Sine qua non for liability under Section 138 of the

Negtiable Instruments Act 1881 is return of a cheque, unpaid by
the banker either because of the amount of money standing to
the credit of that account is insufficient to honour the cheque or
that the cheque exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from
that account by an agreement between the account holder and
the bank.
20.

The complaint does not state that the banker's cheque

was dishonoured on account of either of the two grounds on
which an action can be founded under Section 138 of the N.I.Act.

Crl.M.C. No.137/04

Page 4 of 5

21.

As noted above, the banker had duly informed the

complainant when notice of demand was served that the banker's
cheque was not being honoured because the account of the
customer had been attached by the income tax authorities and
notwithstanding said attachment, by mistake, the banker's
cheque in question was issued. Thus, on a mere reading of the
complaint it would be evident that cognizance of the complaint
could not have been taken by the learned Magistrate.
22.

I clarify once again that tort of negligence is not an

ingredient of an offence under Section 138 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act 1881.
23.

The petition is accordingly allowed.

24.

Summoning order against the petitioners and the

criminal complaint filed by M/s.Omniplast Pvt. Ltd. under Section
138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 are quashed.
