KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
The present appeal is filed against the award of
the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal dated 20.9.2007.

The

facts of the present case in nutshell are:On 5.11.2005 at about 2.00 p.m., deceased Shri
Dheeraj Singh was travelling as a pillion rider on the
motorcycle bearing registration No. DL-8S-AD 7165, which
was being driven by his cousin Shri Sohan Pal, while going
from Delhi to Ghaziabad. At about 2.00 p.m., they reached
near Loni Road in front of Pasaunda, when a DTC bus
bearing registration No. DL IP B 0606, which was being
driven by respondent No.1 at a very high speed in rash and
negligent manner on the wrong side of the road. The said
DTC bus hit the motorcycle and as a result his cousin Sohan
Pal sustained grevious injuries. The claim petition was filed
on 2.6.2006 and the award was made on 20.9.2007.
Aggrieved with the said award, the appellant insurance
company has preferred this appeal.

Counsel for the appellant contends that the
Tribunal has not taken into consideration the rational

of

the recent judgment of the Apex Court in the matter of New
India Assurance Co.Ltd. Vs. Satender & Ors., reported
in III (2007 ACC 46 (SC).
The contention of the counsel for the appellant is
that the notional income of the deceased who was 16 years
old

was taken into consideration as per the Second

Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act and

then the Tribunal

has doubled the said notional income

after taking into

consideration the inflationary trends and rise in price index
and not only this

then again the said assumed income of

Rs.30,000/- has been doubled as per the criteria laid down
by the Supreme Court in Sarla Dixit Vs.Balwant Yadav &
Ors., 1996 ACJ 581 (SC).
I have heard

the

learned counsel for the

appellant and have also perused the impugned award as
well as judgment cited by the counsel for the appellant.
The deceased in the present case was 16 years
MAC. APP. No. 662/2007

Page 3 of 6

old student of XIth standard. It is thus an admitted case
that the child was not

employed anywhere and had no

source of income. In such circumstances, the Tribunal has
taken the notional income of the deceased at Rs.15,000/per annum as provided in the Second Schedule of the Motor
Vehicles Act.

In

New India Assurance Co's case

(Supra), accident of 9 years old child was involved and the
notional income of Rs.15,000/- was applied. In the said case
also the Tribunal had doubled the notional income to Rs.
30,000/- and thereafter the applicable multiplier
applied.

The matter went

before the

was

Hon'ble Supreme

Court after challenge was made by the Insurance Company
and the Hon'ble Supreme Court upheld the contentions of
the Insurance Company

by holding that

in the

case of

young children of tender age, in view of uncertainties
abound, neither their income at the time of death nor the
prospects of the future increase in their income nor chances
of advancement of their career are capable of proper
determination on estimated basis.
MAC. APP. No. 662/2007

Relevant para 12 of the
Page 4 of 6

aforesaid judgment is reproduced as under:
“12. In cases of young children
of tender age, in view of uncertainties
abound, neither their income at the time
of death nor the prospects of the future
increase in their income nor chances of
advancement of their career are capable
of proper determination on estimated
basis. The reason is that at such an
early age, the uncertainties in regard to
their academic pursuits, achievements in
career and thereafter advancement in
life are so many that nothing can be
assumed with reasonable certainty.
Therefore, neither the income of the
deceased child is capable of assessment
on estimated basis nor the financial loss
suffered by the parents is capable of
mathematical computation.”
Counsel for

the appellant states that

it is just

possible that the said judgment was not brought

to the

notice of the Tribunal before passing of the impugned award.
Since the Tribunal has not gone through the said judgment
of the Apex Court, therefore, it would be appropriate
remand

the matter back to the Tribunal for

to

fresh

consideration on that aspect of the matter.
With these directions, appeal is remanded back to
MAC. APP. No. 662/2007

the Tribunal. The appellant to appear before the Tribunal on
22.11.2007.
Appeal stands disposed of accordingly.
