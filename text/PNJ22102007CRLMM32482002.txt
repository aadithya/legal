1.

Petitioners have been impleaded as accused in a complaint

filed by Shri A.K.Fotedar,

Inspecting

Assistant

Commissioner, Income Tax Department, Government of India under
Section 276(B) of the Income Tax Act.
2.

Petitioner

of

Crl.M.C.No.3248/2002

is

accused

No.1.

Petitioners of Crl.M.C.No.307/2003 are the Directors of the first
accused, i.e. the company.
3.

Gravement of the allegations in the complaint are that

pertaining to the assessment year 1983-84, the company and its
Directors violated the provisions of the Income Tax Act pertaining to
deduction of tax at source, in that, Rs.2,25,690/- which had to be
deducted as tax at source under Section 195 (1) of the Income Tax Act
was not fully deposited in the treasury and only Rs.86,340/- was
deposited with the Treasury.
4.

According to the petitioners the tax at source had to be

deducted and deposited only at the time of making payment and not
when money was credited to the account of the person to whom it was
to be paid and that in respect of the transaction in question it had to
pay royalty to a foreign national. For the assessment year in question,
total royalty payable was Rs.6,42,376/-. 40% of the royalty had to be
deducted at source, i.e. Rs.2,25,690/- had to be deducted. That the
Reserve Bank of India did not give permission to remit the money to
the foreign company and hence notwithstanding the company having
credited Rs.6,42,376/- payable towards royalty since
actually

paid,

nothing

had

to

be

none

was

paid to the Government

Treasury.

Petitioners explain having deposited Rs.86,340/- as an

erroneous deposit of tax at source at their end.
5.

Section 195 (1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 as existing in

the assessment year 1983-84 reads as under :“195 (1)
Any person responsible for paying to a nonresident, not being a company, or to a company which is
neither an Indian company nor a company which has made
the prescribed arrangements for the declaration and
payment of dividends within India, any interest, not being
“Interest on securities”, or any other sum, not being
dividends, chargeable under the provisions of this Act, shall,
at the time of payment, unless he is himself liable to pay any
income-tax thereon as an agent, deduct income-tax thereon
at the rates in force:
Provided :

****

Provided further :
6.

****
****

****”

The aforesaid provision was amended in the year 1987. As

amended, Section 195(1) reads as under :“195. (1) Any person responsible for paying to a nonresident, not being a company, or to a foreign company, any
interest (not being interest on securities) or any other sum
chargeable under the provisions of this Act (not being
income chargeable under the head “salaries” shall, at the
time of credit of such income to the account of the payee or
at the time of payment thereof in cash or by the issue of a
cheque or draft or by any other mode, whichever is earlier,
deduct income tax thereon at the rates in force.
Provided
7.

****

****

Provided further
****
* * * *”
A bare perusal of Sub-Section 1 of Section 195 as it existed

in the assessment year 1983-84 reveals that tax had to be deducted at
source at the time of making payment to the payee.

In 1987, the

provision was amended making it mandatory to deposit with the
Income Tax authorities the tax at source at the time amount was
credited to the account of the payee.
8.

In the complaint filed by Income Tax authorities there is no

averment that the accused persons made any payment to M/s. Fabcon
Inc., the foreign company to whom royalty was payable. Only averment
is that the accused company debited Rs.2,25,690/- as the royalty
payable to said American Company.
9.

In that view of the matter, in view of the legislative

provision in force as of the assessment year 1983-84, ex-facie, no
offence

has been disclosed as having been committed by the

petitioners.
10.

I thus dispose of the petitions quashing the order dated

19.2.2001 passed by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate summoning
petitioners to face trial.

I also quash criminal complaint being

Complaint No.1783/1987.
11.

No costs.
