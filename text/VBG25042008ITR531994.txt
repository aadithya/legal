This reference has been made to this Court under
Section 256(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (for short as
„Act‟) by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench
„E‟ in ITA No.3112/Del/91 relevant for the assessment year
1989-90.

The Tribunal has referred the following question for

the opinion of this Court:“Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances
of the case, the Tribunal was right in upholding
order of Assessing Officer computing taxable
gain at Rs.6,60,000/- for the assessment year
1989-90?”
3.

The brief facts of this case as they appear from the

paper book are that the assessee in the period relevant to
assessment year 1989-90 owned a house at Jorbagh, New
Delhi.

He sold the ground floor of that house for a

consideration of Rs.30,00,000/- The cost of construction of
the ground floor was shown to be Rs.1,25,000/- and the
expense for brokerage were claimed at Rs.45,000/-. Thus,
the

transaction

resulted

in

a

capital

gains

of

Rs.

28,30,000/-. The assessee also purchased a residential
house for a consideration of Rs.8,90,000/- and also invested
a sum of Rs.6,00,000/- in I.D.B.I. Bonds.

The question

before the Assessing Officer was whether deduction under
section 48(2) of the Act should be first allowed from the
gross capital gain of Rs.28,30,000/- or it should be allowed
after making deductions for investment in the purchase of
new flat and I.D.B.I. Bonds. The assessee claimed that the

ITR No.53/1994

Page 2 of 10

deductions under sec.48(2) of the Act should be first
allowed to the extent of Rs.14,20,000/- and thereafter, the
cost of the new residential flat and the bonds should be
made deductable. As per the assessee‟s computation, the
capital gain came to nil. The Assessing Officer, however,
declined to accept the formula suggested by the assessee
and proceeded to first deduct the amount of investment
made by the assessee in the purchase of flat and bonds
amounting to Rs.15,00,000/- in the aggregate.

The

assessee returned capital gain „nil‟ as per the following
calculation:Rs.

The Assessing Officer, however, did not accept this
and worked out the capital gains as under:“Sale Consideration

4.

The assessee challenged the above computation

before CIT(A) who considered in details the relevant
provisions and concluded that first deductions under sec.48
of the Act are to be made and then provisions of sections
53 and 54 of the Act are to be applied. She accordingly
accepted the claim of the assessee.
5.

The Revenue then brought the issue in appeal before

the Appellate Tribunal.

The Appellate Tribunal after

consideration of the rival submissions of parties and
relevant statutory provisions agreed with the view taken by
the Assessing Officer. Consequently, it allowed appeal of
the Revenue and referred the above question for opinion of
this Court.
6.

In response to the question of law, learned counsel

for the assessee contended that while calculating the

ITR No.53/1994

Page 4 of 10

deduction under section 48(2) of the Act, no restriction has
been imposed in the Act that the deduction should be given
only after working out the exemption under section 54 of
the Act. Further, he pointed out that specific explanation
has been inserted after section 53 of the Act that the
deduction under section 53 and 54 of the Act will be given
on the gross capital gains calculated under section 48 (1)
of the Act. Thus, the deduction under section 48(2) of the
Act is only reference to the gross capital gains arrived at as
per the provisions of section 48(1) of the Act and nowhere
in the Act, it is stated that this will be restricted to the
amount arrived at after giving the deduction under section
53 and 54 of the Act. Therefore, the assessee is entitled for
deduction under section 48 (2) of the Act before giving the
deduction under section 53 & 54 of the Act. Ld. Counsel
also cited Commissioner of Income Tax v. V.V.George,
(1997) 227 ITR 893 in support of its contentions.
7.

The learned Counsel for Revenue, on the other hand,

supported the order of the assessing officer on the ground
that the scheme of sections 45 & 48 of the Act clearly

ITR No.53/1994

Page 5 of 10

makes it a case that deductions under sections 54 & 54E of
the Act shall be made in the beginning of the computation.
8.

Capital gains have been made chargeable to income

tax under section 45 of the Act. Section 45 (1) of the Act
provides:
“Any profits or gains arising from the transfer of
a capital asset effected in the previous year
shall, save as otherwise provided in sections 53,
54, 54B, 54D, 54E, 54F, 54G and 54H, be
chargeable to income-tax under the head
“capital gains”, and shall be deemed to be the
income of the previous year in which the
transfer took place.”
9.

Section 48 of the Act refers to the

mode of

computation and deduction for the income chargeable
under the head „capital gains‟. Section 48 of the Act lays
down:
“(1) The income chargeable under the head
"Capital Gains" shall be computed;

(a)by deducting from the full value of the

consideration received or accruing as a
result of the transfer of the capital asset the
following amounts, namely:-

(i)

expenditure incurred wholly and
exclusively in connection with such a
transfer;
(ii)
the cost of acquisition of the asset
and the cost of any improvement thereto:

ITR No.53/1994

Page 6 of 10

(b)

where the capital gain arises from
the transfer of a long-term capital asset
(hereafter in this section referred to,
respectively as long-term capital gain and
long-term capital asset) by making the
further deductions specified in sub-section
(2).
(2) The deductions referred to in clause (b)
of sub-section (1) are the following namely:

(a) where the amount of long-term capital

gain
arrived at after
making the
deductions under clause (a) of sub-section
(1) does not exceed ten thousand rupees,
the whole of such amount;

(b)

in any other case, ten thousand
rupees as increased by a sum equal to:

(i) in respect of long-term capital gain
so arrived at relating to capital assets,
being buildings or lands or any rights in
buildings or lands or gold, bullion or
jewellery,-

(A) in the case of a company, ten

percent of the amount of such gain in
excess of ten thousand rupees;

(B) in the case of any other assessee,

fifty percent of the amount of such
gain in excess of ten thousand rupees.

(ii) in respect of long term capital gain so
arrived at relating to capital assets, -

(A) in the case of a company, thirty
percent of the amount of such
gain in excess of ten thousand
rupees;

ITR No.53/1994

Page 7 of 10

(B) in any other case, sixty percent of
the amount of such gain in excess
of ten thousand rupees;”
10.

The explanation to section 53 of the Act provides:
“In this section and in sections 54, 54B, 54D,
54E, 54F and 54G references to capital gain
shall be construed as references to the
amount of capital gains as computed under
clause (a) of sub-section (1) of section 48.”

11.

In Commissioner of Income Tax v. V.V.George,

(1997) 227 ITR 893, the Kerala High Court held that;
“Capital gains” basically relate to a situation of
transfer of a capital asset, resulting into either
profits or gains as a result thereof. Section 45 of
the Act itself makes it clear that even though this
is the ordinary position, the statutory provisions
of sections 53, 54, 54B, 54D, 54E, 54F and 54G
are in the nature of exceptions thereto. We are
concerned with section 54E which is in the
nature of an exception from the plain language of
the statute.”
Further, the Court held:“Section 48(1)(a) of the Act speaks of the ways of
computation and the first aspect is in the process
of computation by deduction from the full value
of the consideration received, two items, viz.,
expenditure incurred wholly and exclusively and
the cost of acquisition in regard thereto.
Incidentally section 48(1)(b) of the Act speaks of
the statutory provision relating to the transfer of
a long-term capital asset providing for further
deductions specified in section 48(2).”
Further held:-

ITR No.53/1994

Page 8 of 10

“It is in the statutory provision of Section 53 of
the Act, the Explanation under consideration
comes on the statute as a result of the Finance
Act, 1987, with effect from April 1, 1987. The said
Explanation is reproduced herein below:
"In this section and in Sections 54, 54B, 54D, 54E,
54F and 54G, references to capital gain shall be
construed as references to the amount of capital
gain as computed under Clause (a) of Sub-section
(1) of Section 48."
Therefore, in computing Capital gains the
provisions of section 48(2) of the Act should be
given effect to before giving effect to the
provisions of section 54E of the Act.”
12.

The deductions specified under sub-section (2) of

sec.48 of the Act is with reference to the gross capital
gains calculated under clause (a) of sub-section (1) only.
Nowhere in the Act is it specified that this deduction is
subject and restricted to the deductions to be allowed
under section 53 & 54 of the Act.
13.

This is so in order that the assessee would get the full

benefit of the deduction on the gross capital gains as
otherwise, the deduction would be allowed only after the
capital gains have been computed as per section 48 of the
Act i.e. both sub-section (1) and (2).

ITR No.53/1994

Page 9 of 10

14.

However no such explanation or proviso is given in

section 48 of the Act, that the deduction to be allowed
under sub-clause (b) of sub-section (1) of section 48 of the
Act is subject to the deduction allowed under section 53
and 54 of the Act.
15.

When the deduction is calculated under section 48 of

the Act, it has to be calculated under both sub-section (1)
(a) and (1) (b) of the same section.
16.

Under the circumstances, deduction under section

48(2) of the Act will have to allowed on the amount
calculated under sec.48 (1)(a) of the Act and before giving
deduction under section 53 and 54 of the Act.
17.

In view of the clear position in law, we answer the

question in the negative, in favour of the Assessee and
against the Revenue.
18.

Thus, the reference stands disposed of as above.
