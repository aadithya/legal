(hereinafter

referred to as DSIDC) has been allowed.
2.

Plaintiff is aggrieved by the said order.

Hence,

the instant petition invoking remedy under Article 227 of the
Constitution of India.
3.

Shorn of unnecessary details, relevant for the

purposes of adjudication of the matter in issue within the
confines of Order 1 Rule 10 CPC, relevant facts are that the
plaintiff filed a suit for ejectment, mesne profits/damages
alleging that she had inducted the defendant as a licensee to
use a portion of Shed No. 22, DSIDC Complex, Okhla Phase
II, Scheme II, New Delhi. That the license was for a period of
3 years effective from 1.9.1990.
Rs.19,000/- per month.

That the license fee was

That terms of license were to be

found in a written deed dated 27.8.1990. That contrary to
the terms of license, the defendant has trespassed into
unlicensed areas within the shed.
4.

In

the

written

statement

filed,

the

license

agreement has not been denied. It is stated that the plaintiff
was an allottee under DSIDC's hire purchase scheme. That
the plaintiff had violated the terms of allotment and DSIDC
had initiated action for eviction of not only the plaintiff but

of

That under the said scheme,

defendant had accepted offer of DSIDC to have the allotment
regularized in its favour.
5.

Various issues were framed on the pleadings of

the parties. Needless to state, an issue was framed whether
the plaintiff is entitled to recover possession of the suit
property from the defendant.
6.

The issues were framed on 19.9.2002.

Parties

proceeded to lead their evidence. Evidence was recorded.
On 19.1.2006 case was notified for final arguments to be
heard on 28.1.2006.

Parties were directed to file their

written submissions. On 28.1.2006, plaintiff filed the written
submissions.

Matter was renotified for the defendant to

submit it's written statement. On 3.2.2007 the application
under Order 1 Rule 10 CPC was filed by the defendant
stating that in view of the defence taken in the written
statement, namely, that DSIDC which had allotted the shed
to the plaintiff under a hire purchase scheme had floated a
scheme to regularize allotment in favour of the person who

CM(M) No.645/07

Page 3 of

was occupying the premises, presence of DSIDC was
necessary for a final and a proper adjudication of the suit.
Learned Trial Judge has allowed the said application.
7.

To be fair to the parties, I may note that various

events have transpired after DSIDC allotted, under its hire
purchase scheme, the shed to the plaintiff and thus learned
counsel made extensive reference to the said facts. But in
my opinion, an extensive narration of the said facts would
result in penning down facts which ultimately have no
bearing upon the issue, for the reason said facts relate to the
passing of an order of eviction under the Public Premises
(eviction of unauthorized occupation) Act 1971 by the Estate
Officer, DDA. Challenge thereto by way of an appeal and a
further challenge by way of a writ petition.
8.

Suffice would it be to note that the respondent

has filed a writ petition in this Court registered as W.P.(C)
No.12589/2006 praying that DSIDC should be directed to
formalize allotment of the shed in the name of the
respondent and execute a lease deed in its favour.
9.

During pendency of the said writ petition, DSIDC

has executed a conveyance deed on 13.11.2006 in favour of

CM(M) No.645/07

dismissed.
registered

With the result, W.P.(C) No.12589/2006 was

The respondent has filed another writ petition,
as

W.P.(C)

No.2589/07

challenging

the

conveyance deed executed by DSIDC in favour of the
petitioner.
10.

The principle of law that a tenant or a licensee

cannot question the title of the lessor or the licensor as the
case may be is subject to an exception, namely, it does not
apply where the plea taken is that after grant of the license
or the lease, the licensor or the lessor as the case may be
has lost the title.

If after so pleading, the licensee or the

lessee pleads a direct attornment under a third party,
presence of the said third party would be necessary in a suit
for possession. The estopple contemplated by Section 116
of the Indian Evidence Act is restricted to the denial of title
at the commencement of the tenancy and does not extend
to a plea of title being lost after the tenancy was created.
[See AIR 1987 SC 1656 Mangat Ram Vs. Sardar Meharban
Singh; Halsbury's Laws Of England, IVth Edition, Para 238
AIR 1987 SC 2192 D.Satyanarayana Vs. P.Jagadish and

Pertaining to a litigation where the subject matter

thereof would result in a declaration as regards status or a
legal character, summarizing Order 1 Rule 10 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, in the report published as AIR 1958 SC 886
Raziya Begum Vs. Sahebzadi Anwar Begum, in para 13,
Supreme Court observed as under:“(13) As a result of these considerations, we have
arrived at the following conclusions :
(1) That the question of addition of parties
under R.10 of O.1 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
is generally not one of initial jurisdiction of the
court, but of a judicial discretion which has to be
exercised in view of all the facts and
circumstances of a particular case; but in some
cases, it may raise controversies as to the power
of the court, in contradiction to its inherent
jurisdiction, or, in other words, of jurisdiction in
the limited sense in which it is used in S. 115 of
the Code;
(2) That in a suit relating to property, in order
that a person may be added as a party, he
should have a direct interest as distinguished
from a commercial interest, in the subject-matter
of the litigation;
(3) Where the subject-matter of a litigation, is
a declaration as regards status or a legal
character, the rule of present or direct interest
may be relaxed in a suitable case where the
court is of the opinion that by adding that party,
it would be in a better position effectually and
completely to adjudicate upon the controversy;
(4)

The

cases

contemplated

in

the

last

proposition, have to be determined in
accordance with the statutory provisions of Ss.
42 and 43 of the Specific Relief Act;
(5) In cases covered by those statutory
provisions, the court is not bound to grant the
declaration prayed for, on a mere admission of
the claim by the defendant, if the court has
reasons to insist upon a clear proof apart from
the admission;
(6) The result of a declaratory decree on the
question of status, such as in controversy in the
instant case, affects not only the parties actually
before the Court, but generations to come, and
in view of that consideration, the rule of 'present
interest', as evolved by case law relating to
disputes about property does not apply with full
force; and
(7) the rule laid down in S. 43 of the Specific
Relief Act, is not exactly a rule of res judicata. It
is narrower in one sense and wider in another.”
12.

Thus, at first blush, considering the nature of the

defence raised by the respondent in the written statement,
impugned order appears to be in harmony with the various
decisions noted in paras 10 and 11 above, but the impugned
order has to be set aside for the simple reason, the
controversy pertaining to formalization of possession of the
respondent directly under DSIDC has taken a different legal
shape with DSIDC executing a conveyance deed in favour of
the plaintiff, which conveyance deed has been challenged by

CM(M) No.645/07

Page 7 of
9

the respondent by and under WP(C) No.2589/07 in this court.
13.

Thus, as of today, admitted facts between the

parties are that DSIDC recognizes the petitioner as the
allottee under DSIDC.
executed.

A conveyance deed has been

The legality of the action of DSIDC is being

adjudicated under a writ petition filed by the respondent.
14.

If DSIDC would be permitted to be impleaded as a

co-defendant in the suit filed by the petitioner, the
respondent would have to then amend the written statement
and lay a challenge to the action of DSIDC in executing a
conveyance deed in favour of the plaintiff.

This would

change the very nature of the suit. It would no longer be a
case of a tenant or a licensee protecting possession on the
plea that the licensor or lessor has lost title after the grant
and that some third party has acquired title to the property
and that the defendant has attorned to said third party.
15.

Needless to state, respondent has invoked an

independent remedy to question the conveyance deed
executed by DSIDC in favour of the plaintiff.
16.

The petition succeeds.

Impugned order dated

5.3.2007 is quashed. Respondent's application under Order

CM(M) No.645/07

Page 8 of
9

1 Rule 10 CPC is dismissed.
17.

However, since it cannot be said that the

respondent's application was wholly frivolous and since issue
debated was an issue which merited consideration, I refrain
from imposing any cost.
