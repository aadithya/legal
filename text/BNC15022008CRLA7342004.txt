dacoity and murder of one Raju at House No.G-394
Mangol Puri, Delhi on the intervening night of
11/12th of May, 2001. Appellant Sanjay @ Moni was
apprehended by Constable Bodh Raj Singh and
Constable Parvinder Singh at D Block, Mangolpuri,
Delhi immediately after commission of said dacoity
and murder.

At the relevant time both the

said

Constables were on patrolling duty. They noticed 67 boys coming from

the side of

E Block, who on

being asked to stop started running away. On a
chase, Constables Bodh Raj

Singh and Parvinder

Singh succeeded in overpowering appellant Sanjay @
Moni. On his personal search two gold bangles and
a cash amount of Rs.1507/- were recovered from
right pocket of his trouser. Possession thereof he
could not explain satisfactorily.

He confirmed that the house in question belonged

by him was brother-in-law of both the brothers as

to a nursing home to take care of his nephew who
was admitted there. The wife and children of Rohtas
were

Jagdish.

The

deceased Raju was alone there in the house when
the incident took place. The dead body of Raju was
found lying on the floor. There were multiple stab
wounds on his person and a lot of blood was
splattered on the floor.

The almirah was

found

open and articles therein ransacked. The statement
of Jagdish was reduced into writing on the basis of

of

Mr. Soni that all the

articles

from

the

appellants were witnessed by the police officials only
and in the absence of any independent witness to
such recoveries particularly in case of

appellants

Shekhar and Sunil @ Pandit, these recoveries could
not have been held proved. It was contended that
the incriminating items allegedly recovered from
respective appellants were packed and sealed in
different parcels using the same seal

on different

dates and as the seal continued to be retained by the

there was

It was further

Mr. Soni also contended that the claim of the police
of solving a blind case of robbery and murder by

no DD entries being proved on record to establish
that

It is not the investigative acumen rather a

chance

success in solving a blind case of dacoity/robbery
and murder in the given case. Such a success story
begins with

place on way back to Police Station Mangol Puri after
attending a call at Sanjay Gandhi Hospital.

establish that they were actually present in the area

This omission apart, a comparative reading of the

developments

following

concerning
alleged

apprehension of appellant Sanjay @ Moni, also
confounds the situation.

Afflicted

by glaring

contradictions, the depositions of these witnesses
fall short of being assuring from prosecution's point
of view.

It is to be noticed that according to

Constable Bodh Raj Singh, PW-10, Head Constable
Ajay Pal, PW-3 and Constable Shokinder Singh, PW8

had

arrived

about

30

Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

after

Page 16 of 36

the

apprehension of appellant Sanjay @ Moni.

Within

another 15 minutes SI Vikram Singh, PW-15,
accompanied by Constable Raghvinder also reached
there.

Appellant Sanjay @ Moni, states Constable

Bodh Raj Singh, PW-10, was subjected to personal
search

two gold bangles and an

amount of Rs.1507/-, in the presence of Head
Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3 and Constable Shokinder
Singh, PW-8. On the contrary, Constable Parvinder
Singh, PW-14 affirmed that it was Head Constable
Ajay Pal, PW-3, who had conducted

the personal

search of the appellant Sanjay @ Moni yielding the
said recoveries.

On the point as to who

had

conducted personal search of appellant Sanjay @
Moni, statements of Constable Bodh Raj Singh, PW10 and Constable Parvinder Singh, PW-14 are thus
contradictory to each other.

The testimony

of

of them is supported by Head Constable

Ajay Pal, PW-3 or Inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16.

both stated that

on their reaching

was being

detained by Constable Bodh Raj Singh, PW-10 and
Constable Parvinder Singh, PW-14, the appellant
Sanjay @ Moni was produced before Inspector S.K.
Saxena, PW-16 alongwith two gold bangles and a
sum of Rs.1507/-.

Clearly, according to Head

Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3 and Inspector S.K. Saxena,
PW-16 the personal search of appellant Sanjay @
Moni

had already been carried out before their

reaching the place. Constable Shokinder Singh, PW8 on the other hand came out with an altogether
different version.

According to him the personal

search of appellant Sanjay @ Moni was conducted
by Inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16 only resulting into
said recoveries.

Mutually contradictory statements

of these witnesses, as noticed, apart from putting a
question mark on the alleged apprehension of the
appellant Sanjay @ Moni and recovery of

the two

gold bangles and an amount of Rs.1507/- from him
also appear to negate their very presence in the
Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

Page 18 of 36

area as claimed.
16.

Another aspect of the matter impacting

claim of the
present

the

aforesaid police officials of being

in the area on night petrolling

is that

neither Constable Bodh Raj Singh, PW-10 nor
Constable Parvinder Singh, PW-14 spoke about the
presence of Inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16 either at
the time

when alleged recovery of the two gold

bangles and Rs.1507/- was effected from appellant
Sanjay @ Moni
produced before

or

when the said appellant was

Head Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3.

From the statements of both

these witnesses it

turns out that Head Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3 and
Constable Shokinder Singh, PW-8 were not keeping
company with Inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16 when
they had arrived at

the place of apprehension of

appellant Sanjay @ Moni,

though Inspector S.K.

Saxena, PW-16, Head Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3 and
Constable Shokinder Singh, PW-8

claimed that

they had reached there together. The statement of
Constable Bodh Raj Singh, PW-10 rather discloses
Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

Page 19 of 36

that Inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16 had arrived at
the scene of crime only. To the same effect is the
statement of Constable Parvinder Singh, PW-14 as
well. Thus, if testimony of both these constables are
to be accepted, Inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16 was
nowhere in picture at any point of time before they
reached the place of crime.

This is clearly

in

contradiction to the statements of Inspector S.K.
Saxena, PW-16, Head Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3,
Constable

Shokinder Singh, PW-8 and SI Vikram

Singh, PW-15 to the effect that

the appellant

Sanjay @ Moni had led the police officials, headed
by Inspector S.K. Saxena,
Thus

doubt

to the place of crime.

regarding actual presence

of the

aforesaid police officials in the area in connection
with night petrolling in the absence of relevant DD
entries being proved on record

grows stronger

in

view of aforesaid inconsistencies in the statements
of the said prosecution witnesses in regard to the
apprehension and arrest of appellant Sanjay @ Moni
as also recovery of two gold bangles and cash
Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

Page 20 of 36

amount of Rs.1507/- from him.

In the given

situation where the very apprehension and recovery
of aforesaid incriminating items from the person of
the appellant Sanjay @ Moni are rendered suspect,
the prosecution case that the appellant Sanjay @
Moni had led the police party to the scene of crime
can also be not viewed beyond doubt.
17.

Shifting to crime scene, in the face of doubt

in regard to the

police officials being led thereto by

the appellant Sanjay @ Moni, the factum of police
officials reaching there at about 3.45 am is also
difficult to accept for the simple reason that if the
alleged pointing out of the place of crime by the
appellant Sanjay @ Moni on his apprehension is left
apart, the police officials could not have had any
clue of the crimes
hour of night.

If one goes by the statement of

Jagdish, PW-1, Inspector

S.K. Saxena,

PW-16,

accompanied by some police officials, would appear
to have

12th May, 2001 to

take him along to the place of

S.K. Saxena, PW-16 SI Vikram Singh, PW-15, Head
Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3, Constable Shokinder
Singh, PW-8, Constable Bod Raj Singh, PW-10 and
Constable Parvinder Singh, PW-14 however testified
that all of them had reached

the scene of crime

only and Jagdish, PW-1 was called from his house
later on noticing a dead body lying there and the
house being found ransacked. If such statements of
said police officials are to be believed, Jagdish, PW1, on his reaching the house of his brother Rohtas,
PW-2, would have come across with Inspector S.K.
Saxena, PW-16 and other police officials being
already present inside the house but that was not
so. According to Jagdish, PW-1 when he reached the
house of his brother, he

saw two police officials

present there outside the house. Further, from his
statement it is noticed that he as well as the police
officials entered the house No.G-394 Mangol Puri,
Delhi simultaneously.

Had Inspector S.K. Saxena,

Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

Page 22 of 36

PW-16 and other police officials been already present
inside the house

there could be no reason

for

Jagdish, PW-1 making statement to the said effect
belying their presence at the scene of crime before
his reaching there. Contradictory position emerging
out of

the affirmations of Jagdish, PW-1 on one

hand and that of the said police officials

on the

other also causes doubt on prosecution's claim that
the police officials

headed by Inspector

S.K.

Saxena, PW-16 were led to the scene of crime by the
appellant Sanjay @ Moni.

According

to

prosecution

version,

the

appellant Sanjay @ Moni apart from disclosing the
names of

accomplices in his alleged disclosure

statement also led to recovery

of a razor Ex. P-1

from a nearby park. Recovery of razor Ex. P-1 was
not taken as part of incriminating circumstance to
hold the

appellant Sanjay @ Moni guilty of the

charges of robbery and murder. A reference to this
recovery would nevertheless be not out of place to
test the credibility

and fairness of investigative

Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

Page 23 of 36

exercise. Strangely,

inspite of presence of a large

number of people from the neighbourhood none of
them was joined to witness the alleged recovery of
razor Ex. P-1. Inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16 found
it more convenient
namely,

SI

to associate his subordinates,

Vikram

Singh,

PW-15

and

Head

Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3 only as witnesses to such
recovery vide Ex. P-3/D. Even though Jagdish, PW1 has not signed the seizure memo Ex. P-3/D as a
witness to recovery

of razor Ex.P-1,

from the

statement of Head Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3 it is
gathered that he was also present at the relevant
time of recovery of razor Ex. P-1. Jagdish PW-1 also
stated that
effected in

the recovery of razor Ex. P-1 was
his presence.

He, of course, did not

support the statements of Head Constable Ajay Pal,
PW-3, SI Vikram Singh, PW-15 and Inspector S.K.
Saxena, PW-16 that the razor Ex. P-1 was the same
which had been

recovered at the instance of the

appellant Sanjay @ Moni. There is no unanimity on
the part of Head Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3, SI

recovered from outside the boundry wall from the
park near the road”. According to SI Vikram Singh,
PW-15 “the razor was lying in the corner of the
park”. Head Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3 and SI Vikram
Singh, PW-15 both affirmed that at the time of
recovery of razor Ex.P-1 its blade was blood stained.
Jagdish, PW-1 on the other hand in the first
instance stated that

the recovery of razor Ex. P-1

was effected “from near the wall and a nala” and on
being reexamined by learned Addl. P.P. he added
that the recovery was in fact from the nullah near
the wall of the park and the razor Ex.P-1 was taken
out by the appellant Sanjay @ Moni from the mud of
nullah.

This

witness

did

not

support

the

statements of the said two police officials that the
blade of razor Ex. P-1 was blood stained at the time
of its recovery. Given the nature of statements of
Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

Page 25 of 36

the said witnesses to recovery of razor Ex. P-1 the
learned trial court did well by ignoring

recovery

thereof and not taking the same into account as one
of the circumstances for convicting appellant Sanjay
@ Moni.

Adverting to seizure of blood stained T-Shirt

Ex. P-9 from the person of appellant Sanjay @ Moni
the way such seizure was stated to have been made
is not

free from doubt.

According to

Head

Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3, Constable Shokinder
Singh, PW-8, Constable Bodh Raj Singh, PW-10,
Constable Parvinder Singh, PW-14 and Inspector
S.K. Saxena, PW-16, appellant Sanjay @ Moni was
wearing

T-Shirt Ex. P-9 at the time of his

apprehension with blood stains on it. Having come
to the finding that the apprehension of the appellant
Sanjay @ Moni at the given time and place has not
been proved beyond doubt,

related to such seizure which cannot be lost sight

Page 26 of 36

of. SI Vikram Singh, PW-15 initially in the course of
his examination in chief recorded on 26th July, 2003
and 19th August, 2003 did not make any specific
mention of seizure of T-Shirt Ex. P-9 from the person
of the appellant Sanjay @ Moni.

He rather stated

that Inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16 apart from lifting
blood, blood stained earth and earth control from
the spot also took into his possession some blood
stained clothes lying there.

Inspector S.K. Saxena,

PW-16, Head Constable Ajay Pal, PW-3, Constable
Shokinder Singh, PW-8, Constable Bodh Raj Singh,
PW-10 and Constable Parvinder Singh, PW-14 do
not speak of seizure of any blood stained clothes
from the spot.

In the context of aforesaid initial

statement of SI Vikram Singh, PW-15 it is significant
to make a note of the statement of Jagdish, PW-1 in
this connection.

He testified that

at the spot he

noticed the appellant Sanjay @ Moni wearing a
Baniyan and a pant and his shirt was lying near
the dead body. This part of statement of Jagdish,
PW-1 appears to be in line with the aforementioned
Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

initial statement of SI Vikram Singh, PW-15.

SI

Vikram Singh, PW-15 made amends in his said
initial statement in the

course of recording of his

further statement on 1st September, 2003 while
identifying

T-Shirt Ex. P-9 and adding that the

same was being

Anyway, since the

very apprehension of the appellant Sanjay @ Moni as
also his leading the police officials to the place of
crime has been held not proved beyond doubt, the
seizure of T-shirt Ex. P-9 which was on examination
by serology division of CFSL found to bear blood
stains matching deceased's blood group is also liable
to be treated on the same plane.

The presence of

blood on T-Shirt Ex. P-9 matching the blood group
of the

deceased in the circumstances cannot be

treated to provide a basis to connect the appellant
Sanjay @ Moni with the given robbery and murder.

Co-appellant Shekhar and Sunil @ Pandit

were held guilty and convicted for robbery and

circumstances,

recovery of part of jewelery

namely,

items and some cash

amount at their instance as also in view of their
finger prints being found at the

scene of crime.

Appellant Shekhar was arrested on 16th May, 2001
and he allegedly led to recovery of a pair of ear tops
and an iron rod from his house in the presence of SI
Vikram Singh, PW-15 and Head Constable Ajay Pal,
PW-3 vide Ex. P3/G.

Similarly, his co-appellant

Sunil @ Pandit on his arrest on 24th May, 2001 got a
golden chain and a cash of Rs.2000/- recovered
from his house in the presence of SI Vikram Singh,
PW15 vide Ex. P-15/D. The pair of ear tops Ex. P4/1-2 and the chain Ex. P-14 as well as cash
amount of Rs.2000/- Ex. P-13/1-20 were identified
as part of

robbed property, by Rohtas PW-2.

Interestingly, either at the time of lodging the FIR or
at any point

of time thereafter, no list of jewelery

and cash which had been robbed was
furnished to the

ever

police. Though Inspector S.K.

Not only

that no list of

21.

Yet another reason for being sceptical about

the said recoveries from appellants Shekhar and
Sunil @ Pandit is the absence of testimony of any
independent witness from public.

No reason for

refrain to join witnesses from public at the time of
respective recoveries inspite of a good number of
people being present is not forthcoming. Inspector
S.K. Saxena, PW-16 categorically admitted that he
had omitted to join any person from public to
witness the recovery.

Given the

questionable

manner of handling of the investigation as noticed
Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

Page 31 of 36

heretofore, non-joining of any witness from public
cannot be taken to be just an innocent omission on
the part of the Investigating Officer and in the
circumstances, it sounds highly unsafe to hold that
the

aforesaid

recoveries

were

actually

effected

pursuant to disclosures by appellants Shekahr and
Sunil @ Pandit respectively. Such recoveries thus
cannot

be taken to constitute an incriminating

circumstance to find their complicity.
22.

Presence of chance finger prints of appellants

Shekhar and Sunil @ Pandit was accepted by the
learned trial court as another circumstance, apart
from aforesaid recoveries of part of robbed property,
for holding them guilty of robbery and

murder as

also for being in possession of stolen property.
Barring inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16, no other
police official, who are shown to have been present
at the scene of crime from the very start, deposed
that any chance finger prints were lifted from the
scene of crime.

They simply affirmed about crime

team visiting the spot.

While other police officials

Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

Page 32 of 36

were not questioned in regard to the time of arrival
of the crime team at the spot, Inspector S.K. Saxena,
PW-16

and

SI

Vikram

Singh,

PW-15

made

statements inconsistent with each other. Contrary to
Inspector S.K. Saxena's claim of crime team visiting
the spot at 7.00 am or thereabout, SI Vikaram
Singh, PW-15 mentioned

the time of crime team's

visit to the spot at about 10/11.00 am.

SI Anuj

Kumar Bhati, PW-20 who was stated to have lifted
the

chance finger prints from the spot claimed to

have reached the place of crime at about 8.00 am.
He, as stated by him, lifted the chance finger prints
from an almirah, a refrigerator and a steel glass,
developed the chance finger prints so lifted and left
the spot

at about 9.00 am after handing over his

report to Inspector S.K. Saxena, PW-16.

Inspector

S.K. Saxena, PW-16 is however silent on developed
photographs of chance finger prints lifted from the
spot alongwith

report being handed over to him at

the spot by SI Anuj Kumar Bhati, PW-20. No memo

as

None of the

items from where the chance finger prints had been
lifted were taken into

possession by the police to

preserve and produce the same as piece of evidence.
Further, even though the developed photographs of
chance finger prints were made available by SI Anuj
Kumar Bhati, PW-20 to Inspector S.K. Saxena,
PW-16 on 12th May, 2001 itself and specimen finger
prints of appellant Sanjay @ Moni were also available
in view of his being already in police custody, the
specimen finger prints

and chance finger prints

were sent to finger print bureau for comparison as
late as in July 2001 only after appellants Shekhar
and Sunil @ Pandit were arrested on 16th May, 2001
and 24th May, 2001 respectively.

The reason for

such delay in sending the developed chance finger
prints and specimen finger prints of appellant
Sanjay @ Moni as also of appellants Shekhar and
Sunil @ Pandit are not decipherable
Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

from record.

Page 34 of 36

Needless to point out that the chance finger prints
initially sent to finger print bureau in July, 2001 for
comparison with specimen finger prints of appellant
Sanjay @ Moni did not match his finger prints.
Notably, even though according to Inspector S.K.
Saxena,

PW-16

the

specimen

finger

prints

of

appellants Shekhar and Sunil @ Pandit were also
available and could have been sent to finger print
bureau for comparison alongwith specimen finger
prints of appellant Sanjay @ Moni but for reasons
not indicated on record this was not done.

The

specimen finger prints of appellants Shekahr and
Sunil @ Pandit were sent for comparison as late as
on 24th February, 2004 when the trial had almost
come to a close.
there is a nagging

Viewed in the light of aforesaid,
doubt in regard to the chance

finger prints, which were sent for comparison with
specimen finger prints of appellants Shekhar and
Sunil @ Pandit, being actually lifted from the scene
of crime on 12th May, 2001 as claimed.
23.

In view of aforesaid, it is difficult to subscribe

Crl. Appeal No.734/04 & Crl. Appeal No.374/04

Page 35 of 36

to the view taken by the learned trial court that the
circumstances brought out by the prosecution to
sustain an inference of guilt against the appellants
stand firmly established

and the same unerringly

point towards guilt of the appellants. The impugned
conviction and sentence are thus liable to be set
aside.

Both the appeals are accordingly allowed and
judgment of conviction and order of sentence

against the appellants are set aside. Consequently,
the appellants are acquitted of the charges and are
directed to be released immediately unless required
to be detained in connection with any other case.
Sh. Anil Soni shall be paid a fee of Rs.25,000/- for
representing the appellants.
