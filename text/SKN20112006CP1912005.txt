SANJIV KHANNA, J :

1. Deutsche Homoopathie-Union DHU-Arzneittel GmbH & Co. KG (hereinafter
referred to as the petitioner, for short) has filed two Company Petition Nos.
191/2005 and 192/2005 under Sections 433(e), (f), Section 434 read with
Section 439 of the Companies Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, for
short ) for winding up of M/s R.K. Import Private Limited and German
Homoeopathic Distributors Private Limited (hereinafter referred to as R.K.
Imports and German respectively and collectively as the respondent
companies).
2. It is the case of the petitioner that R.K. Imports and German were appointed
as sole agents for sale and distribution of homeopathic medicines of Dr.
Willmar Schwabe Arzneimittel GmbH and Co.KG. The said agreement was
signed and executed in June, 1998 and expired by efflux of time on 31st
March, 2003.

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 3

3. In CP No. 191/2005, it is stated that R.K. Imports had placed two orders on
the petitioner for purchase of homeopathic medicines in the month of October,
2003 and the supplies were made but payment as agreed upon, of EUROs
34,804.78 has not been made by R.K. Imports.
4. In CP No. 192/2005, it has been alleged that during the period 19 th May,
2003 onwards, German had placed as many as eight different supply orders
for purchase of homeopathic medicines. These were duly supplied but
payment of EUROs 1,428,483.64 has not been made. It is further stated that a
credit note for EUROs 480.20 was issued because of over delivery of goods
and after reducing this amount the total outstanding amount due payable by
the German to the petitioner is EUROs 1428,003.44.

5. The petitioner has stated that procedure followed by the parties was that
R.K. Imports and German would place orders for purchase of homeopathic
medicines. On receipt of the order, the petitioner would send a letter of
confirmation along with proforma invoice to the R. K. Imports or German as
the case may be. The Homeopathic medicine were released and the shipping
documents were forwarded to the respondent companies through the banks of
the parties. These documents were leased, only after acceptance by R.K.
Imports or German and on their agreeing to pay amount on the maturity date.
The bank of the respondent companies used to then inform the bank of the

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 4

petitioner that the documents have been accepted by R.K. Import or German.
The respondent companies were liable to make payment 75 days after the
date of the invoice.
6. The two respondent companies have filed identical response/reply. The
placement of orders, the supplies, invoices raised and the amount due and
payable under the invoices by the respondent companies have not been
disputed. Respondent companies have, however, raised counter claims against
the petitioner and its associate companies. It is further claimed that vide letter
dated 5th July, 2002, in terms of Clause VIII of agreement dated 24th June, 1998
under a tacit understanding the said agreement was extended for a further period
of one year i.e. upto 31st March, 2004. Some other contentions were also raised
and these have been noticed and dealt with in this order.

7. In support of the defence raised by the respondent companies, a number of
judgments of Supreme Court and High Courts have been referred to in the
written submissions. However, I feel I need not specifically refer to case law
cited by both the parties, as the principles of law are well settled and have
already been examined in depth and detail by the Supreme Court and this
Court in similar cases. While dealing with the scope of Section 433(e) of the
Act, Supreme Court in the case of Madhusudan Gordhandas & Co. versus
Madhu Woollen Industries Private Limited, AIR 1971 (3) SCC 632 has
observed as follows:-

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 5

“20. Two rules are well settled. First, if the debt is bona fide

disputed and the defence is a substantial one, the court will
not wind up the company. The court has dismissed a
petition for winding up where the creditor claimed a sum for
goods sold to the company and the company contended
that no price had been agreed upon and the sum
demanded by the creditor was unreasonable. (See London
and Paris Banking Corporation 1874 LR 19 Eq 444) Again,
a petition for winding up by a creditor who claimed payment
of an agreed sum for work done for the company when the
company contended that the work had not been properly
was not allowed. (See Re. Brighton Club and Horfold Hotel
Co. Ltd. 1865 (35) Beav 204)
21. Where the debt is undisputed the court will not act upon
a defence that the company has the ability to pay the debt
but the company chooses not to pay that particular debt,
see Re. A Company. (94 SJ 369) Where however there is
no doubt that the company owes the creditor a debt entitling
him to a winding up order but the exact amount of the debt
is disputed the court will make a winding up order without
requiring the creditor to quantify the debt precisely See Re
Tweeds Garages Ltd. (1962 Ch 406) The principles on
which the court acts are first that the defence of the
company is in good faith and one of substance, secondly,
the defence is likely to succeed in point of law and thirdly
the company adduces prima facie proof of the facts on
which the defence depends.”
8. The above view of the Supreme Court has been re-affirmed in Pradeshiya
Industrial

and

Investment

Corporation

of

U.P.

versus

North

India

Petrochemicals Limited and Another, 1994 (3) SCC 348.
8A. A company can be ordered to be wound-up if it is unable to pay its debts
as per clause (e) to section 433 of the Act. Section 434 by a deeming
provision stipulates three situtations when a company is presumed to be

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 6

unable to pay its debts. We are concerned with Section 434(1)(a) of the Act.
The clause requires issue of three weeks notice by the creditor to the
company for payment and on neglect to pay or secure/compound it to the
reasonable satisfaction of the creditor, the company is deemed to be unable
to pay its debts. The word "neglect" used in 434(1)(a) of the Act is significant
and is the foundation of the section. Neglect implies ommission to pay without
reasonable cause. Ommission to pay is not by itself a reasonable cause
(Yashodan Chit fund Pvt. Ltd. In re (1980) 50 Com. Cases 356). A company
being a body corporate, should not neglect to pay the dues of its creditors.
When notice is given and there is failure to pay, without reasonable cause,
presumption operates and the deeming clause entitles the creditor to file a
petition for winding up. Insolvency of the company is presumed, once
conditions of section 434(1)(a) are satisfied. Creditor is saved from proving
and establishing value of the current assets, liabilities etc. Nothing else is
required to be examined. Deliberate or contumacious refusal to pay an
admitted debt without reasonable cause cannot be a defence. Argument that
the company opted to be sequestrate and not pay should be rejected as
dishonest, repugnant to legal principles of good-faith and fairness on which
the Act is based. The subsumption is that no rational and solvent person will
fail to pay his creditors as per terms. Law presumes that a debtor company
shall pay, if it can do so, rather than have a winding up petition against it. It is

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 7

for this reason that non payment on the expiry of the period of notice is treated
as presumptive proof of insolvency.
9. The question whether counter claim can be a valid shield and defence to a
winding up petition, under Section 433(e) of the Act has been considered by
this Court in the Jubilant Organosys Limited versus DCM Shriram Industries
Limited 2004 VI AD (Delhi) 383. In this judgment, reference was made to two
earlier decisions of Wimco Limited versus Sidvink Properties (P) Limited, 1996
(86) Company Cases 610 and J.N. Roy Chowdhury (Traders) P. Limited
versus Jainti Enterprises, 1987 (61) Company Cases 504. It has been held
that a counter claim can be a legitimate ground to deny payment of a debt
due. However, counter claim should be prima facie bona fide and not one
which is frivolous or mala fide. In such cases, it can not be said that the
company, which is sought to be wound up on the ground of inability to pay
debt, has neglected to pay inspite of receipt of statutory notice. A genuine
counter claim will constitute a reasonable excuse and a cause not to make
payment. Thus, even when defence by way of counter claim is raised before
the Company Court, the respondent company can rebut the statutory
presumption under Section 434 (1) (a) of the Act by showing prima facie that
the counter claim raised is in good faith and one of substance and not mala
fide. Secondly, the defence or the counter claim is likely to succeed on the

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 8

point of law and thirdly prima facie proof of facts on which the counter claim is
based should be adduced and filed before the Court. If these conditions are
satisfied, the Company Court will go no further and will not decide the dispute
itself but leave it to the civil court.
10. In this regard, I may also make reference to judgment of the Court of
Appeal in Re Bayoil Statement of Affairs Seawind Tankers Corp. versus
Bayoil SA , (1999) 1 All England Law Reporter 374. This decision reiterates
that where a debt is undisputed but the company sought to be wound up
raises a genuine and serious counter claim exceeding the amount of the
petitioner's debt, a winding up petition is not maintainable. However, to
succeed, the company must show that the counter claim has been raised in
good faith on substantial grounds and, therefore, the petitioner, who has
approached the Court cannot be regarded as a creditor. If there is no
substance in the counter claim and the same has been raised just as a bogie,
the winding up petition can be entertained and proceeded further.
11. Counter Claims or claims to be an effective and complete sheild must
exceed the admitted claim. If a company does not dispute the debt owed, and
has no genuine cross claim which might offset it, the petition should be
granted. If a company asserts a substantial counter claim equal to or more
than the debt, the petition should be dismissed. The counter claim or claims

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 9

should be genuine and serious and should exceed the amount of the
petitioner's debt.
12. In light of the well settled principles, I proceed to examine various counter
claims raised by the respondent companies and whether the same are
genuine and raise serious disputes. We have to also examine whether the
genuine counter claims exceed the debt due. While doing so, we have to keep
in mind the three factors/principles as per the decision of the Supreme Court
in Madhusudan Gordhadas (supra) that (i) the defence has been raised in
good faith and in substance, (ii) the defence is likely to succeed in the point of
law, and (iii) the respondent companies have adduced prima facie proof of the
facts on which the defence depends.
(A) Counter claim towards payment of commission of EUROs
219,243.45.
13. It is admitted that under the agreement dated 24th June, 1998 the
respondent companies were entitled to commission on the purchases made.
This agreement was between the respondent companies and Dr. Willmar
Schwabe GmbH & Co. KG. It was however admitted that commission was
paid by affiliates of the Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. KG, who were not
signatory to the aforesaid agreement on purchases made by the two
respondent companies. The agreement dated 24th June, 1998 had expired on

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 10

31st March, 2003 but commission was paid on the purchases made thereafter
from the petitioner. Even prior to the aforesaid agreement, commission was
being paid on the sales made by the petitioner in terms of the earlier
agreement(s) executed between the respondent companies and Dr. Willmar
Schwabe GmbH & Co. KG. I have therefore while examining this counter
claim and other counter claims presumed that the petitioner is bound by the
agreement and correspondence exchanged between the respondent
companies and the Schwabe group as a whole.
14. The respondent companies have also relied upon e-mail dated 5th July,
2002 and clause VIII of the agreement dated 24th June, 1998 and submitted
that by implication and on tacit understanding the agreement was extended
for one more year i.e. upto 31st March, 2004.
15. These are questions of fact and prima facie evidence in support has been
filed. This counter claim cannot be outright rejected or regarded as a frivolous
counter claim made without any basis. The respondent companies have been
working as agents for the affiliate of the petitioner for the last thirty years and
throughout they have been paid commission even on purchases made from
the petitioner. The commission claimed is as per the agreement dated 24th
June, 1998. To this extent, therefore, I feel the respondents have a genuine
and a substantial counter claim for EUROs 219,243.45.

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 11

(B) Repurchase of stock
16. In this regard the respondent company has relied upon Clause IX of the
agreement dated 24th June, 1998, which reads as under:“On the termination of this agreement, regardless of

reasons, GERMAN shall immediately stop using the
name SCHWABE in any connection whatsoever. In
case of such termination it is, however, understood
that SCHWABE is prepared to re-purchase stocks of
the SCHWABE preparations delivered under this
Agreement, in good and saleable condition, limited to
a three-months requirement, besides all other goods
which are in transit from SCHWABE to GERMAN at
the time of termination of this Agreement, at landed
cost price. Other stocks must be destroyed by
GERMAN at his costs.”

17. The counter claim made in this regard is for EUROs 350,017. The
respondent companies have referred to letter dated 5th November, 2004
written by Dr. Amitabh Sen, Advocate retained by the said companies. In the
said letter, Dr. Amitabh Sen, has relied on Clause IX above and has stated
that the petitioner was liable to repurchase the entire stocks of Schwabe
preparations including goods in transit. It was further stated that if repurchase
was not made within 14 days, the respondent companies will assume that the
petitioner was not interested in removing the stocks and disposal of the same.
However, details of the stocks etc. were not mentioned in this letter. These

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 12

details were supplied by another letter dated 8th December, 2004. While giving
details, the respondent companies merely mentioned the closing stock
available with them as on 31st October, 2004.
18. The stand of the petitioner is that Clause IX will not apply as the
agreement dated 24th June, 1998 had expired by efflux of time and was not
terminated and, therefore, the said clause has no application. The respondent
companies, however, dispute the said contention and the ground that the
agreement was extended upto 31st March, 2004 and have referred to letter
dated 9th September, 2002 and wherein, the petitioner has specifically stated
“we hereby terminate the agreement”.
19. It is the case of the respondent companies themselves that the agreement
was extended upto 31st March, 2004. For examining this counter claim I shall
presume that the stand of the respondent companies is correct that clause IX
of the agreement dated 24th June, 1998 applies on termination and also on
expiry by efflux of time and by tacit understanding the agreement was
extended upto 31st March, 2004. I shall also presume that the agreement
was/is binding and applicable to the petitioner. The first letter written by the
respondent companies for repurchase was on 24th November, 2004 i.e. after
lapse of nearly eight months. Moreover, Clause IX as quoted above
specifically provides that repurchase of stock would be limited to three months

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 13

requirement and the other balance stock would have to be destroyed by the
respondent companies at their own cost. Neither in the letters nor in the
pleadings the respondent companies have pointed out or stated “the threemonths requirement” as mentioned in Clause IX nor was any letter written
within the three month period. The details furnished and mentioned in the
letter dated 8th December, 2004 only refers to the “closing stock available”
with the respondent companies and not to the three-months requirement.
Other stocks had to be destroyed by the respondent companies at their own
cost. In the absence of any prima facie evidence and material produced by the
respondent companies, I cannot accept this counter claim raised by the
respondent companies as genuine and substantial. No prima facie material
and evidence in support has been submitted. Even otherwise the respondent
companies in their letter dated 5th November, 2004 written by their counsel
had clearly stated that they shall dispose of or destroy the stock at the cost
and expense of the petitioner. No details in this regard have been furnished
and it has not been stated whether stock has been sold, partly sold, destroyed
or partly destroyed.
20. I, therefore, feel that the counter claim in this regard cannot be regarded
as genuine, bona fide and of substantial nature.
(C) Counter claim on account of expenses incurred on labelling

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 14

21. The respondents companies have made counter claim of EUROs 260,000
for labelling of products imported from the petitioner and other affiliate
companies. It is admitted that under agreement no payment is due and
payable to the respondent companies on account of labelling. However, the
respondent companies have placed reliance on letters/e-mails exchanged
between the parties. In the letter/e-mail dated 26th June, 2001, the respondent
companies had raised claim for fixing labels on the wrappers on per piece
basis. In response, "the petitioner"/Schwabe agreed to pay compensation of
EURO 60,000 for the year 2002 vide their e-mail dated 16th January, 2003.
The respondent companies felt that this was rather low and asked for
payment of EUROs 90,000 per annum from the year 2000 awards, but as a
gesture of good-will and as a measure of compromise agreed to accept
EUROs 75,000 per annum for the calender years 2001 and 2002. "The
petitioner"/Schwabe, however, replied back vide e-mail dated 20th January,
2003 that they cannot accept and include year 2001 for reimbursement
purposes and agreed to make lump sum payment of EUROs 75,000 for the
year 2002. Admittedly, this compensation for the said amount for the year
2002 has been made and accepted. Similarly, for the year 2003, the parties
mutually agreed to compensation of EUROs 75,000 being paid, though initially
the petitioner had some reservation about the said amount. The additional

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 15

claim now made for 2002 and 2003 is therefore without substance and not
bonafide.
22. The claim for labelling relating to year 2000 is clearly barred by limitation
and the claim for labelling for the year 2004, is an after thought. In the letter
dated 5th November, 2004 the respondent companies had only claimed for
additional cost of labelling for the years 2000-2001 and no claim was made for
the year 2004.
23. However, with regard to claim for the year 2001, the petitioner in the email dated 20th January, 2003 has admitted that some payment was agreed to
be made but nothing was fully finalised. In these circumstances, I hold that the
claim for labelling for the year 2001 @ EUROs 75,000 appears to be a
genuine counter claim, which requires investigation and trial. However, there
is no justification for the balance amount of the counter claim and the same
cannot be regarded as genuine and substantial.
(D) Counter claim of EUROs 9,32,500 towards compensation as a result
of red alert issued by WHO on eye-drops supplied by the petitioner:

24. The break-up of this counter-claim has been given in letter dated 12th
December, 2002 and reads as under :-

25. WHO, Geneva had issued a warning in respect of eye-drops
manufactured by the petitioner and 10% of the samples on testing did not
meet the sterility criteria. Ban was imposed by the Indian authorities.

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 18

26. It is the case of the respondent companies that that their business
reputation had suffered and stupendous effort had to be undertaken to get
clearances from the concerned authorities and for reintroduction of the
product. It is also claimed that questions were asked in the Parliament about
the quality of the product and the entire spade work including getting
necessary approval after testing from the authorities and reintroduction of the
product was a result of time, effort and money devoted and spent by the
respondent-companies.
27. From the break-up of the claim given above, it is apparent that the
respondent-companies have claimed compensation, on account of reputation,
goodwill, harassment, etc, of EUROs 5,00,000, which is equal to about Rs.3
crores. Out of pocket expenses for visit to authorities etc. Of EUROs 27500
has been separately claimed. In addition, Rs.1.40 crores (EUROs 2,50,000) is
also claimed on account of expenses and losses as it is alleged that the
selling price was much lower than actual cost on reintroduction of the product.
Fee of Rs.57 lacs (approx) (EUROs I,00,000) has been claimed for getting
“new CMS job done for the petitioner” and EUROs 55000 have been claimed
under different heads for out- of-pocket expenses, for getting tests done and
obtaining approvals. On the face of it the claims are inflated and excessive.

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 19

No documents justifying the quantum claimed or in support thereof have been
filed.
28. The claim for compensation of Rs.3 crores on the face of it is exorbitant
and without any foundation. The respondent-companies have not pointed out
any reduction in profits or details of alleged loss incurred by them. Besides,
the claim is overlapping as separate amounts have been claimed for
expenses incurred for getting necessary approvals and fee of EUROs 100000
(Rs. 56Lacs approx.) for getting the work done.
29. The basis on which these claims have been quantified has not been
explained and is based on ipse dixit of the respondent companies. Keeping in
mind the amount claimed, some justification and basis should have been
disclosed. The said claims do not qualify and cannot be regarded as genuine
counter claims of substance. Under the Contract Act normally actual damges
suffered can be awarded. There are no allegations, justification and material
to support these claims.
30. Similarly for claim of EUROs 250000/- no material to show difference
between actual cost and selling price has been placed on record.
Documentary evidence to prima facie show losses should have been placed
on record.

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 20

31. I may however mention here that some of the eye-drops imported by the
respondent-companies from "the petitioner"/Schwabe in the year 1999 had to
be destroyed because they were found to be sub-standard by the Indian
authorities. This is clear from the certificate dated 22nd June, 2000 issued by
the Deputy Drug Controller (India), Mumbai. The said supplies relate to
shipping bill no.100201894 dated 30th December, 1999. Moreover, efforts
made by the respondent companies have not been denied.
32. The respondent companies except mentioning the figures have not placed
any material to justify the quantum claimed. However taking a liberal view rest
of the counter claim of EUROs 182500 is treated as a defence to the debt
claimed. This includes EUROs 100000 claimed by the respondent companies
towards fee for getting CMS done. The figure and claim of EUROs 100000 is
also relevant and kept in mind for deciding claims for damages under different
heads.

(E) REIMBURSEMENT FOR SUPPLIES MADE IN 2003-04

33. It is claimed that the respondent-companies are entitled to 50% reduction
in the purchase price as the supplies were manufactured in Czechoslovakia
whereas in the shipping documents as well as on the invoices it was stated

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 21

that the medicines were "made in Germany". Counter-claim of EUROs
9,75,000 has been made by the respondent-companies in this regard.
34. The petitioner has not disputed that some of the medicines supplied in the
year 2002-03 were manufactured in Czechoslovakia. However, it is stated that
the goods were not misdescribed as under the provisions of the German law,
the said goods were "made in Germany".
35. The claim made by the respondent-companies is for mishandling or for
defective supplies.Along with the reply the respondent-companies have
enclosed therewith only one letter dated 9th September, 2004 which makes
reference to an earlier letter dated 20th April, 2004. It is apparent from these
two letters that no claim in this regard was made in 2003 and/or at the time
when they accepted the said goods and even when payments were made.
Even the letter dated 20th April, 2004 has not been placed on record by the
respondent-companies. In letter dated 9th September, 2004 no specific claim
in this regard has been made.
36. The respondent-companies have filed a chart giving details of the
supplies, the subject matter of the counter-claim on the ground of
"misdescription". The chart filed shows that the goods were supplied between
April 2002-October 2003 and do not relate to the period 2003-2004.

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 22

37. Section 41 of the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, entitles a buyer to examine the
goods delivered, which he did not examine previously. Section 42 of the Act
provides that if within reasonable time the buyer does not intimate the seller
that he has rejected the goods (or that they they do not meet the
description/quality etc.), then he is deemed to have accepted the goods.
38. Section 13(2) further provides that once the buyer has accepted the goods
(though he may have a right to reject them) even in breach of any condition to
be fulfilled by the seller then such a breach is treated as one of warranty.
Thus, buyer shall nomore be entitled to reject the goods in view of Section
12(3) though he may claim damages according to the methods under Section
59, one of them being setting up against the seller the breach of warranty in
diminution or extinction of price.
39. In case of Svenska Handelsbanken v. Indian Charge Chrome, (1994) 1
SCC 502 the Supreme Court on the facts of the case held:
“84. It will be noticed that in the present case prima facie the

provision for capacity of the power plant being of 108 MW
was a condition. Therefore, the plaintiff could have
repudiated the contract as provided in Section 12(2) of the
Sale of Goods Act or treated as a warranty by waiving the
condition or elect to treat the breach of the condition as a
breach of warranty and not as a ground for treating the
contract as repudiated.
85. In the present case the plaintiff has not repudiated the
contract. In fact it is working with the power plant and,
therefore, the breach of condition has been treated by the

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 23

plaintiff as a breach of warranty and in view of Section 12(3)
of the Sale of Goods Act, the breach of warranty gives a
right to claim for damages but not to a right to reject the
goods and treat the contract as repudiated. Even the prayer
in the plaint is for diminution of the price of the power plant
and the relief is based on Section 59 of the Sale of Goods
Act.”

40. The Respondent Companies claim that the Petitioner supplied defective
medicines since from its packing it claimed to have been manufactured in
Germany though the same had been manufactured and packed in
Czechoslovakia. However the Respondent companies did not raise any
dispute with respect to the quantity or quality of the medicines so supplied, in
spite of the alleged breach of condition by the Petitioner, (viz. medicines
manufactured in Czechoslovakia and not in Germany) as a result of which the
right to reject the goods stands waived. However, in view of the above
provisions the Respondent Companies were entitled to set up a claim under
Section 59 against the seller for breach of warranty by claiming diminution or
extinction of price. This was not done and full payments were made. This
belated claim therefore deserves to be rejected as not substantial and bona
fide.
41. This claim is an after-thought as first letter raising the counter-claim in this
regard was made after substantive delay in September, 2004 and that too
once disputes and differences between the parties had arisen. The

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 24

respondent-companies have also not placed on record any material evidence
to show that the medicines supplied were sold at a lower price and/or any loss
of profit was caused to them.
(F) Damages/compensation for breach of contract :
42. Under this heading I shall be examining the following counter claims made
by the respondent companies:
i.

Illegal termination/breach of contract – Euro 3,00,000.

ii.

Breach of confidentiality clause – Euro 5,00,000.

iii.

Bad faith on behalf of Schwabe in deliberately postponing execution of
fresh agreement on one pretext or the other till the Indian arm of the
petitioner got approval for trading activities in India. EUROs -5,00,000.

iv.

Bad faith on behalf of the petitioner in setting up a company in India and
setting up competitive business, thus eliminating and causing loss to the
respondent-company to the tune of EUROs 1,050,000.

43. The above counter-claims are equal to about Rs.12 crores. On the face of
it, these are exorbitant and extortionate claims. The respondent-companies
were required to prima facie satisfy this Court that there is some material and
basis for making these claims and the quantum claimed is based on sound
and intelligible grounds. What can be awarded as damages is the actual
losses suffered and not remote or unforeseen damages. Further the claimant
has to establish breach of a contract by the other party. No doubt different

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 25

agreements were entered into from time to time for 30 years but the same
were for fixed period of time. The rights of the parties were governed by the
agreements. Last Agreement between the Schwabe Group and the
respondent companies was executed on 24th June, 1988 for a limited term till
31st March, 2003. The respondent-companies were aware of the fixed term of
the Agreement. The contract thereafter, as per the respondent-companies,
under a tacit understanding was extended till 31st March, 2004. It is not the
case of the respondent-companies that the orders that were placed on
Schwabe Group were not honoured and supplies were not made during the
term of the Agreement till 31st March, 2003 or even thereafter till 31st March,
2004. On the other hand, it is admitted case of the respondent-companies that
consideration/sale price for the supplies made by the Schwabe Group were
not paid within the stipulated period. The respondent-companies have not
prayed for specific performance of any contract or even argued that the
petitioner was under an obligation to execute any further agreement.
44. As far as incorporation of company-Dr. Wilmer Schwabe India Pvt. Ltd is
concerned, the shareholders/Directors of the respondent-companies were
himself a shareholders of the said company, initially to the extent of 15%.
Subsequently, they did not subscribe to the rights issue and their shareholding
has come down to 6%. The said company was incorporated with a knowledge
and tacit consent/ understanding of the respondent-companies. The
respondent-companies cannot now after indirectly participating in the
incorporation, cry and shed tears. The respondent-companies were also
aware that Dr.Willmer Schwabe India Pvt. Ltd. had been incorporated for

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 26

carrying on business of manufacturing, distributing, selling, buying, importing
homeopathic and herbal medicines.
45. It is stated that the Directors of the respondent-companies have made
investments and purchased shares in Dr.Willmer Dr.Schwabe India Pvt. Ltd.
of about Rs. 3 crores. It is stated that there was mutual understanding and
agreement between Schwabe group and the shareholders of respondentcompanies pursuant to which the aforesaid investment was made in the said
joint venture. The affairs of Dr. Willmer Schwabe India Pvt. Ltd are not subject
matter of the present petition. In the reply, respondent companies have stated
that Mr. Kamlesh Gupta and his family members reserve their right to initiate
appropriate proceedings under Section 397, 398 and 402 of the Act. Inter-se
disputes between the shareholders of the respondent-companies and a third
company i.e. Dr.Willmer Schwabe India Pvt Ltd cannot be regarded as a
counter claim. These are independent and separate matters between the
shareholders of the respondent-company and third parties. Respondentcompanies cannot raise these disputes on the pretext of counter claims.
46. It is quite apparent that the respondent-companies have made up these
counter claims and quantified them only to somehow exceed the value of the
medicines supplied by the petitioner. There is otherwise no basis and
substance in the claims and the quantification made. Quantification has not
been justified and supported on basis of any data and figures. Cause of action
occurs only if actual damages are suffered. The amount of damages can
never exceed the actual direct loss suffered or which is likely to be suffered.
No case for claiming special damages has been specifically pleaded with
documents and allegations in support. I am, therefore, inclined to reject and
hold that the counter claims for damages/compensation are without substance

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 27

and not bonafide. The respondent companies have failed to substantiate that
these counter claims have been made in good-faith, are likely to succeed on
point of law and have also failed to adduce prima facie proof of the facts on
which it is based. However, I have while dealing with counter claim of eye
drops allowed set off of EUROs 1,00,000 claimed as fee. No separate amount
is set off from these claims.
G. Other Counter Claims
47. With regard to debit note of Euro 30,463.01 dated 7.2.2003 no facts have
been pleaded and no documents or materials in support have been filed.
Admittedly, the debit note was dated 7.2.2003 and was accepted by the
respondent companies at the relevant time. Counter claim to this extent is not
genuine. Similarly with regard to alleged frozen commission of EUROs
52,815.37

no

details

have

been

furnished.

The

period

and

the

consignment/purchases for which this alleged commission relates has also
not been stated. This claim therefore cannot be regarded as bonafide.
48. The respondent-companies in the written submissions have raised
objection to the affidavit filed in support of the Petition. Photocopy of the
judgment passed by A.K. Sikri, J. In C.P. No.374/2002 titled Medi Trade
Medical Trading GmbH versus Medisphere Marketing Ltd. has been relied
upon. The said plea is liable to be rejected as no such objection has been
taken in the pleadings. A.K. Sikri, J. in his order has held that a petition for
winding up can be filed by an attorney but the supporting affidavit should be of
a person mentioned under Rule 21 of the Companies (Court ) Rules, 1959 or

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 28

exemption/permission from Court/Registrar for filing an affidavit by another
person should be obtained. But it has been held that failure to comply with
Rule 21 is an irregularity which can be cured.
49. The respondent-companies have not taken this objection in the reply.
They cannot be allowed to take this technical plea in the written submissions.
If this plea had been taken in the pleadings the petitioner could have taken
appropriate remedial action. In D.M. Deshpande v. Janardhan Kashinath
Kadam, (1998) 8 SCC 315, at page 318 it has been observed :
9. Learned counsel for the appellants has relied upon

three decisions in support of his contention that a
vague plea does not justify an issue being framed. In
this connection, a reference was made to Ram Sarup
Gupta v. Bishun Narain Inter College where the Court
has held that all necessary and material facts should
be pleaded by the party in support of the case set up
by it. In the absence of any pleading, evidence if any
produced by the parties cannot be considered. The
object and purpose of a pleading is to enable the
adversary party to know the case of the opponent. In
order to have a fair trial, it is imperative that the parties
should state the essential material facts so that the
other party may not be taken by surprise. The Court
has, however, cautioned against a pedantic approach
to the problem and has directed that the court must
ascertain the substance of the pleading and not the
form, in order to determine the case.

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 29

50. Moreover, I find that power of attorney in favour of Mr. Vikram Grover who
has signed and verified the affidavit in support has been enclosed with the
Petition.

51. In view of the findings given above, the following counter claims raised by
the respondents are held to be substantial and “genuine”:(a) Commission payment EUROs 2,19,243.45
(b) Labelling of EUROs 75,000

c.

Expenditure on CMS
eye-drops, fee and

damages EUROs 1,82,000
-----------------------------------Total EUROs 476243.45
52. The other claims as already discussed above are not genuine counter
claims. The debt due and payable by German is EUROs 14,28,483.64 and the
debt due and payable by R.K. Traders is EUROs 34,804.78. The debt due
and payable by R.K. Traders is less than the total value of the counter claims
found to be of substance and which require investigation and trial. Accordingly
winding up petition against R.K. Traders C.P. No. 191/2005 is liable to be

C.P.Nos.191-192/2005

Page 30

dismissed. However for the same reason and after adjustment of EUROs
34,804.78, the balance, “genuine” counter claims of EUROs 441438.67 is less
than EUROs 1428003.44 which is due and payable by German Homoeopathic
Distributors Private Ltd. Winding up petition 192/2005 against the said
company is therefore admitted.
53. However, I defer orders for publication of citations and appointment of
provisional liquidator for a period of two months to enable the said
respondent-company to pay EUROs 987044.97 (1428003.44 less 441438.67)
along with interest @5% per annum from the date of filing of the Petition till
payment. In case the aforesaid payment is not made, orders for publication of
citations and provisional liquidator will be passed.
