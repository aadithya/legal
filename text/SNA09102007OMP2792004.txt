judgment?

S.N. AGGARWAL, J.
These are two petitions filed by the petitioner against the
respondent. One is under Section 9 and the other is under
Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
Both these petitions are proposed to be decided by this
common judgment because question of facts and law involved
in them are identical.
2

The factual matrix of the case giving rise to these

petitions is as follows:The petitioner is a company incorporated under the
Companies Act, 1956. Mr. Santosh Kumar is the Chairman and
Director of the said company. In November, 2003, the
respondent agreed to sell his agricultural land bearing Khasra
No. 811, House No. 4, known as ESSEL MINI FARM measuring
1029 sq. yds. situated at Village Chattarpur, Tehsil Mehrauli,
New Delhi at a rate of Rs. 5251.00 per sq. yds. for a total
consideration of Rs. 54,03,279.00 to Mr. Santosh Kumar. An
amount of Rs. 5,40,000/- received by the respondent under the
Agreement signed by the respondent with said Mr. Santosh

OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Kumar of the petitioner company on 10.11.2003 vide cheque
No. 707240 dated 08.11.2003 drawn on Indian Overseas Bank,
Yusuf Sarai Branch, New Delhi. Under the Agreement the
vendee Mr. Santosh Kumar was required to pay the balance
sale consideration of Rs. 48,62,279.00 by 15.02.2004 as
stipulated in the said Agreement. Because of alleged breach on
the part of the vendee in not pursuing the transaction any
further, the respondent being the vendor returned the deposit
of Rs. 5,40,000.00 received by him as earnest money from the
vendee and this amount was returned vide Cheque No. 957850
dated 18.08.2004 sent to the vendee vide covering letter
dated

16/18.08.2004

(Annexure

'A'

to

the

respondent's

application under Section 151 CPC being IA No. 6514/2004 in
OMP No. 279/2004). At this point of time, disputes and
differences arose between the parties under the Agreement to
Sell dated 10.11.2003. The said Agreement to Sell contained
an Arbitration Clause being Clause No. 10 whereby the parties
had agreed to get their disputes under the Agreement resolved
by a panel of Arbitrators, one to be appointed by each one of
them. Arbitration was to be governed by the provisions of
Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The Clause 10 of
the Agreement read as under:OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 3 of 16

“That in the event of any dispute arising between
the parties with regard to the applicability of
interpretation of any of the terms and conditions of this
MOU, then such dispute would be resolved by way of
arbitration. Both the parties shall have the right to
appoint one Arbitrator each. And the award given by
these two Arbitrator shall be binding on both the parties.
Such arbitration shall be governed by the provisions of
Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The courts
at Delhi shall have the jurisdiction in the event of any
dispute.”

3

On

or

around

23.08.2004,

the

petitioner

filed

an

application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act, 1996 for ad interim injunction restraining the respondent
from alienating or creating any third party right/charge in the
subject property agreed to be sold vide above referred
Agreement to Sell dated 10.11.2003. This Court vide its interim
order passed on 31.08.2004 in OMP No. 279/2004 restrained
the respondent from selling, disposing of or transferring the suit
property in favour of any third person subject to the petitioner's
depositing the balance sale consideration in the Court within
two weeks. This interim order was modified vide order dated
25.10.2004 to the extent that subject to the petitioner's
depositing a sum of Rs. 25 lacs in the Court within two weeks,
the respondent would stand restrained from selling, disposing
of or transferring the suit property in favour of any third person.
This amount of Rs. 25 lacs was not deposited by the petitioner

OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 4 of 16

within the stipulated time period of two weeks mentioned in
the order dated 25.10.2004. The time for depositing the said
amount was extended till 16.11.2004 without prejudice to the
rights of the parties vide order passed on 08.11.2004. In
compliance of the aforementioned orders, the petitioner
deposited a cheque of Rs. 25 lacs with the Court on
15.11.2004. However, the said cheque deposited by the
petitioner in the Court was received back unpaid from the
Reserve Bank of India with the objection 'Funds insufficient'
and a report in this regard was made by the Registry to the
Court which was taken on record vide order dated 19.01.2005.
Thereafter the proceedings in OMP No. 279/2004 under Section
9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 continued to be
adjourned from time to time till the matter was finally heard
along with the connected petition under Section 11 (6) of the
said Act on 03.10.2007.
4

On or around 11.03.2005, the petitioner filed the

connected petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996 for appointment of Arbitrator in terms of
Arbitration Agreement contained in the Agreement to Sell
dated 10.11.2003 referred above. The plea of the petitioner in
the said petition is that the disputes and differences have
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 5 of 16

arisen between the parties and the same are required to be
resolved through arbitration by the Arbitrator to be appointed
by the Court since the respondent had failed to comply with
the notice dated 16.08.2004 allegedly sent by the petitioner to
the respondent invoking the Arbitration Agreement.
5

The respondent has filed his reply to both these petitions.

His defence is that the petitioner has no locus-standi to file the
said petitions because the respondent did not make any
Agreement to Sell or Arbitration Agreement with the petitioner.
According to the respondent the Agreement to Sell dated
10.11.2003 was with the respondent described as 'vendor' and
Mr. Santosh Kumar described as 'vendee'. The respondent has
further contended in his reply that he did not receive the notice
dated 16.08.2004 described as notice under Section 11(6) of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. According to the
respondent, the petitioner has fabricated the said notice and
he has intentionally not filed any document or record to prove
the dispatch or delivery of the said notice to the respondent.
Furthermore, the respondent has contended that since the
petitioner had committed breach of contract of Agreement to
Sell dated 10.11.2003, the respondent had returned the
advance of Rs. 5,40,000/- received by him from the petitioner
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 6 of 16

and with the refund of the advance/earnest money the
transaction under the Agreement to Sell has come to an end.
According to the respondent, no arbitrable dispute is left
between the parties as the transaction has come to an end and
therefore the respondent has prayed for dismissal of both
these petitions.
6

I have heard the learned counsel for both the parties and

have also perused the entire record including the documents
referred by the counsel for the parties during their arguments.
7

The thrust of arguments of Mr. Singla, learned senior

counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent was that no
arbitrable dispute is left between the parties to be decided by
the Arbitrator. It was further argued by him that the petition
under Section 11(6) is even otherwise liable to be dismissed
because the notice invoking the Arbitration Agreement was
never served by the petitioner upon the respondent before
filing of the said petition. Mr Singla has contended that the
notice dated 16.08.2004 relied upon by the petitioner in his
petition under Section 11(6) is a fabricated document. Mr.
Singla seeks to urge that the petitioner has fabricated antidated documents with a malafide intention to make a false
claim for appointment of an Arbitrator to keep the litigation on
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 7 of 16

with regard to a transaction under the Agreement to Sell dated
10.11.2003 that came to an end on petitioner's encashing the
cheque of Rs. 5,40,000/- sent by the respondent towards
refund of the advance/earnest money.
8

On the other hand, Mr. Sharma, learned senior counsel

appearing on behalf of the petitioner had relied upon a letter
written by the petitioner to the respondent on 05.10.2004
(Annexure 'A' to the reply of the petitioner to IA No. 6514/2004
in OMP No. 279/2004) and on the strength of the said letter, he
had argued that the respondent himself had deposited the
cheque of Rs. 5,40,000/- in the account of the petitioner
without any intimation or taking the consent of the petitioner. It
was submitted that the said cheque was deposited by the
respondent in the account of the petitioner to defeat the
present

proceedings.

Mr.

Sharma

had

urged

that

the

respondent cannot be allowed to take advantage of deposit of
Rs. 5,40,000/- made by him in the account of the petitioner
without his consent or any intimation in this regard. According
to the learned senior counsel for the petitioner disputes and
differences have arisen between the parties under the
Agreement to Sell dated 10.11.2003 and the same are required
to be referred for arbitration in terms of Arbitration Agreement
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 8 of 16

between the parties. He, therefore, requested for appointment
of an independent arbitration by this Court.
9

I have given my thoughtful consideration to the rival

arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties.
10

The first contention of the respondent in opposition to

these petitions is on the point of locus standi of the petitioner
to file the said petitions. The plea of the respondent is that the
Agreement to Sell dated 10.11.2003 which is the basis of these
petitions was executed between the respondent and Mr.
Santosh Kumar, Chairman and Director of the petitioner
company in his individual capacity. To show the same, Mr.
Singla had referred to the first and the last page of the
Agreement in question where the vendee party has been
described as Mr. Santosh Kumar, Chairman and Director of the
petitioner company and on the last page the name of only Mr.
Santosh

Kumar

finds

mention

as

'vendee'

under

the

Agreement. Mr. Singla had relied upon Section 46(1)(a) of the
Companies Act, 1956 in support of his argument that a
contract on behalf of the company can be made on behalf of
the company only by any person acting under its authority,
express or implied. The contention was that in the present case
the Agreement to Sell was made by Mr. Santosh Kumar not on
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 9 of 16

behalf of the company under its authority but in his individual
capacity. To counter this argument, Mr. Sharma learned senior
counsel for the petitioner had referred to a letter dated
08.11.2003 (Annexure P-2 to AA No. 67/2005) addressed to the
respondent written on the letter head of the petitioner
company and signed by its Chairman Mr. Santosh Kumar in
relation to a transaction mentioned in the Agreement to Sell
dated 10.11.2003. With the help of the said letter dated
08.11.2003, Mr. Sharma had argued that the Agreement to Sell
was in fact entered into between the respondent and the
petitioner company and not by Mr. Santosh Kumar in his
individual capacity. The petitioner has filed the true copy of the
extract of the relevant entries of its Account No. 37292 with
Indian Overseas Bank, Yusuf Sarai Branch, New Delhi to show
that the cheque of Rs. 5,40,000/- towards advance/earnest
money was given by the petitioner company and not by Mr.
Santosh Kumar from his personal account. From the letter
dated 08.11.2003 and also the copy of the bank statement
referred above, it appears that the transaction contained in the
Agreement to Sell

dated

10.11.2003

was

between the

respondent and the petitioner company and not with Mr.
Santosh Kumar in his personal capacity as contended on behalf
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 10 of 16

of the respondent. I do not find any substance in the contention
of the respondent that the petitioner has no locus standi to file
these petitions.
11

The next argument of the respondent was that no

arbitrable

dispute

is

left

between the

parties

requiring

appointment of an Arbitrator. The contention of the respondent
was that since the petitioner had committed breach of the
terms

and

conditions

of

the

Agreement

to

Sell

dated

10.11.2003, though the respondent could have forfeited the
earnest money paid by the petitioner but in all fairness, the
respondent has returned the advance/earnest money of
Rs. 5,40,000/- to the petitioner by means of an account payee
cheque vide covering letter dated 16.08.2004 and that the said
cheque has been encashed by the petitioner on 02.09.2004
without any protest. It was submitted that since the petitioner
had

accepted

the

refund

of

advance/earnest

money,

Agreement in question came to an end and does not leave any
dispute require to be arbitrated. The learned senior counsel for
the petitioner in reply to the above argument of the
respondent's counsel relied upon a letter dated 05.10.2004
written by the petitioner to the respondent informing him that
the cheque of Rs. 5,40,000/- was deposited by the respondent
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 11 of 16

himself in the account of the petitioner without his knowledge
or consent and therefore according to the petitioner the
respondent cannot be allowed to take advantage of the said
refund. The learned counsel had further contended that the
petitioner had sent back the cheque of Rs. 5,40,000/- to the
respondent along with his letter dated 05.10.2004. Mr. Singla
appearing on behalf of the respondent had vehemently argued
that the letter dated 05.10.2004 referred above and relied
upon by the petitioner's counsel is a fabricated document and
in support of his argument, he relied upon an endorsement of
Speed Post contained at the bottom of the said letter dated
05.10.2004 to show that the said letter was dispatched by the
petitioner on 15.10.2004 and was received by the respondent
on next day in the afternoon of 16.10.2004. It was submitted
that

the

respondent

had

immediately

replied

the

aforementioned letter of the petitioner dated 05.10.2004
through his reply dated 17.10.2004 denying receipt of the
cheque alleged to had been enclosed by the petitioner with its
letter dated 05.10.2004. The respondent had further shown
that the contention of the petitioner that the cheque of Rs.
5,40,000/- was deposited by the respondent himself in the
account of the petitioner is incorrect on its face in view of the
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 12 of 16

fact that the respondent had sent the cheque of refund amount
to the petitioner along with a covering letter dated 16.08.2004.
The respondent has filed a certificate from Speed Post Centre,
New Delhi to show delivery of his letter dated 16.08.2004 upon
the petitioner on 19.08.2004. The respondent has also filed on
record a certificate from his bank to show that a cheque of Rs.
5,40,000/- sent by him to the petitioner has been credited to
the account of the petitioner on 02.09.2004. These documents
clearly establish that the petitioner had accepted the refund of
earnest money sent by the respondent to it without any protest
or demur in this regard and thereby the petitioner had closed
the transaction of sale-purchase contained in the Agreement to
Sell dated 10.11.2003. This Court is of the view that when the
main transaction between the parties had come to an end, the
question of arbitrating any dispute thereunder would not arise.
It shall further be relevant to mention that in petition under
Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (OMP No.
279/2004), this Court vide its letter dated 25.10.2004 had
directed the petitioner to deposit Rs. 25 lacs towards part
balance sale consideration. The petitioner could not make the
said deposit within the time period granted by the Court and on
his request the time for deposit was extended but still when
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 13 of 16

the petitioner deposited Rs. 25 lacs pursuant to the Court
orders, the cheque of the said amount deposited by the
petitioner was returned unpaid with remarks 'insufficient fund'.
This further shows that the petitioner was not interested in
continuing with the transaction contained in the Agreement to
Sell dated 10.11.2003 and had treated the said transaction
closed for all intents and purposes.
12

Mr. Singla appearing on behalf of the respondent had

argued that the petition under Section 11 even otherwise
cannot be allowed because the mandatory notice invoking the
Arbitration Agreement before filing of the said petition was not
served by the petitioner upon the respondent. The notice dated
16.08.2004 alleged to had been sent by the petitioner to the
respondent was purportedly sent through courier. There is
visible interpolation of date of dispatch mentioned in the
courier receipt filed on record to show dispatch of notice dated
16.08.2004. It may be noted that the petitioner had filed its
petition under Section 9 on or around 23.08.2004 and in the
said petition the petitioner has pleaded that it is also taking the
requisite steps for appointment of arbitrators for resolving the
disputes between the parties. The notice dated 16.08.2004 was
allegedly sent by the petitioner to the respondent before filing
OMP No. 279/2004 & Arb. P. No. 67/2005

Page 14 of 16

of the petition under Section 9. There is not even a whisper in
the said petition about sending of the said notice. In case the
petitioner had sent the notice dated 16.08.2004 before filing of
the petition under Section 9 then this fact must have found
mention in the said petition. Non-disclosure of notice dated
16.08.2004 in petition under Section 9 shows manipulation on
the part of the petitioner. As per the petitioner the notice
invoking the Arbitration Agreement was sent by it to the
respondent through courier. The receipt of courier placed on
record cannot be acted upon because there is visible
interpolation of date in the same. Moreover, no document or
proof has been filed to show the delivery of notice invoking the
Arbitration Agreement on the respondent. Hence the petition
under Section 11 (6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,
1996 cannot be allowed for want of service of notice invoking
the Arbitration Agreement as well. The petition under Section 9
became

infructuous

because

of

non-compliance

of

the

condition of deposit of Rs. 25 lacs imposed by the Court vide
order dated 25.10.2004.
13

In view of the above, these petitions are devoid of any

merit and are therefore dismissed leaving the parties to bear
their own costs.
