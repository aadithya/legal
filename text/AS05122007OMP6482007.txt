petitioner.

of

These

Page 2 of 16

with colour matching draw rope of the value of 1,12,797.60
Euro.
(3) Consignment Contract No. PJN 1198/07 for
supply/export of children bed set, 2 pieces set, printed 100%
polyester micro fiber 110 gsm, Duvet covers and pillow case
with color matching YKK-zipper with white plastic head, with
machine washable 60 decrees of the value of 1,33,860 Euro.

3. As per the agreements, respondent No. 1 was required to
provide Oekotex standard 100 certificate free of charge.
On the request of the petitioner, respondent No. 3, the
bankers

of

the

petitioner

at

Germany,

opened

an

irrevocable Letter of Credit (hereinafter referred to as
'L/C')

bearing

No.

DIA101180

dated

17.7.2007

for

3,24,716.64 Euro with date and place of expiry being
September

03,

2007

and

D-Bielefeld

in

favour

of

respondent No. 1.

4. The amount of the L/C was reduced for short supply of
consignment goods and also because of some consignments
of goods relating to fitted sheets of orange colour and
yellow colour were found on testing by accredited textile
laboratory in Germany 'Forschungsinstitut Hohenstein'
mutually appointed by the petitioner and the respondent

OMP No. 648/2007

Page 3 of 16

No. 1, to be contaminated with forbidden AZO dye stuff
and they did not comply with the Oekotex 100 Standards.

5. The consignment goods sent under contract No. PJN
1194/07 were sent on the condition that if the petitioner's
final

client cancelled

the order

on account

of

non

production of valid Oekotex 100 Standard certificate, the
petitioner shall have the right to return the goods to the
respondent No. 1 and to claim back the paid amount.

The

consigned goods under the consignment contract No.
1194/07 were rejected by the final client at Germany and
the goods had to be transported back by the petitioner.
Petitioner claims a total amount of 183754.91 Euro
inclusive of his transportation and penalty charges imposed
upon it by the final client against respondent No. 1.

Since

there is an arbitration clause in the agreements, present
petition has been filed by the petitioner under Section 9 of
the

Act

seeking

interim

relief

for

restraining

the

respondents from encashing the Letter of Credit.

6. Respondent No. 1 has contested this petition alleging that
as per article 3 of the UCP in case of an irrevocable bank
guarantee or L/C, the buyer cannot obtain injunction
against the banker or the seller on the ground that there

OMP No. 648/2007

Page 4 of 16

was a breach of the contract by the seller. Respondent No.
2 to 4 are not a party to the agreements and therefore,
petition under Section 9 of the Act is not maintainable
against them. Petitioner has not been able to prima facie
make out a case of fraud or that the alleged fraud was also
in the knowledge of the bank issuing L/C. Petitioner has
also not been able to show that an irreparable injury shall
be caused to it or is likely to be caused if the relief sought
for by it is not granted. It is further averred that the agent
of the petitioner in India had conducted the pre-dispatch
inspection of the consignments under contract No. PJN
1194/07 and other contracts. It was on the satisfaction of
the petitioner, the goods were dispatched in September
2007.

As and when the petitioner raised any objections

regarding

short

supply

or

goods

not

upto

Oekotex

certificate standard, the respondent No. 1 immediately
modified/reduced the L/C amount.

Petitioner was aware

that the respondent No. 1 has the oekotex certificate with
regard to articles i.e. woven fabric made of 100%
polyester, dyed which was sent to the petitioner by the
respondent on 21.6.2007.

Petitioner never informed the

respondent No. 1 as to whether the goods under the
contract No. PJN 1194/07 was also submitted to the said
Lab for quality test. It is further averred that there is no
OMP No. 648/2007

Page 5 of 16

violation of the terms and conditions of the L/C and the
petitioner as well as its bankers have accepted the
documents submitted by the respondents No. 1 & 2 after
verifying the same for encashment of the said L/C.
Therefore, present petition is not maintainable.

7. Maintainability of the petition is also challenged on the
grounds that the petitioner has not invoked the arbitration
clause in the agreement till date or even after the filing of
the present application.

8. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have
carefully perused the record.

9. Learned counsel for the petitioner conceded that there is
no dispute regarding the consignments of goods vide
consignment contract PJN 1192/07 and PJN 1198/07 and
the petitioner is ready and willing to make the payments of
the goods sent under the said contracts totaling to
208508.88 Euro and the dispute therefore remains only in
respect of agreement PJN 1194/07.

10.Clause 12 of the consignment contract PJN 1194 is an
arbitration clause which reads as follows:

OMP No. 648/2007

Page 6 of 16

“That the parties to the
agreement, agreed that all the
disputes
or
difference
whatsoever, arising between the
parties, out of or relating to the
construction,
meaning
or/and
operation or effect of this
contract, or the breach thereof,
shall be settled by the Arbitration
in accordance with the Rules of
Arbitrators of the Indian Council
of Arbitration by the Arbitrators
nominated by both the parties
and
the
Award
made,
in
pursuance
thereof,
shall
be
binding on the parties, at New
Delhi.”

11.Since the goods supplied by the respondent No. 1 under
this consignment contract were rejected by the final buyer
of the petitioner and the petitioner has claimed return of
the money against this consignment contract as well as
transportation charges and the penalty levied upon it by
the final buyer, a dispute has arisen between the petitioner
and the respondent No. 1 in terms of the arbitration clause.
The petitioner has not referred the dispute to the arbitral
tribunal till date for adjudication upon the dispute inter se
the parties. Much has been said about the non issuance of
Oekotex standard certificate having not been issued by the
respondent No. 1 in respect of the goods supplied vide
consignment contract No. PJN 1194/07. My attention has
also been drawn to a letter dated 22.9.2007 written by the

OMP No. 648/2007

Page 7 of 16

petitioner to the respondent No. 1 whereby the petitioner
reserved its rights to return back the goods covered under
the said contract because no valid oekotex standard
certificate was presented by the respondent No. 1 in case
the goods were rejected by the final buyer.

Whereas

according to the respondent No. 1, oekotex standard
certificate was sent to the petitioner vide letter dated
21.6.2007.

These issues are not to be considered in this

application as these are the matters and disputes to be
decided by the arbitral tribunal. The only issue before me
for consideration is whether the petitioner is entitled to the
relief as claimed for restraining the respondents from
invoking the L/C No. DIA101180 which was issued on
17.7.2007 and date and place of expiry is shown as
3.9.2007 and beneficiary is shown to be respondent No. 1.
As per this L/C, the deferred payment was 90 days after
B/L date.

The rules applicable are UCP latest version.

After the L/C was opened on 14.9.2007 by the respondents
No. 3 & 4, bill of exchange for 321346.14 Euro was issued.
As per this bill of exchange, the payment was to be made to
the Order of Bank of Baroda, CFS branch, Law Garden,
Ahmedabad, India.

Thus, it is clear that L/C was

negotiated and enforced.

OMP No. 648/2007

Page 8 of 16

12.Clause 47A of the L/C reads as follows:

“Additional conditions
After receipt of credit
conform documents in Bielefeld,
we will cover the bank presenting
documents according to their
instructions 90 days after date of
Bill of Lading.”

13.The bill of lading in respect of the goods covered under
impugned agreement is dated 7.9.2007. Therefore, since
bill of exchange had already been issued, the L/C has been
acted upon. It is pertinent to say that there is only one bill
of lading for all the three consignment contracts and no
separate L/C has been prepared in respect of consignment
No. PJN 1194/07 and only one bill of exchange is prepared
for all the three consignments. Therefore, L/C cannot be
bifurcated into two by separating the claim of the
petitioner in respect of consignment No. PJN 1194/07.

14.Under these circumstances, respondent No. 1 cannot be
restrained from invoking the L/C as prayed in para (a) of
the prayer clause. However, interest of the petitioner can
be protected by issuing appropriate directions to the
respondent No. 1 as an alternative relief as claimed in para
(c) of the prayer clause. The claim of the petitioner is for

OMP No. 648/2007

Page 9 of 16

1,16,207.76 Euro as against the consignment order No.
PJN 1194/07.

15.Petitioner has also sought restraining order against
respondents No. 2 to 4 who happened to be the bankers of
the respondent No. 1 and petitioner respectively.

This

L/C is governed by rules laid down in UCP latest version.

16.Article 3 of UCP 500 reads as follows:

“Credits v. Contracts
a. Credits, by their nature,
are separate transactions from
the sales or other contract(s) on
which they may be based and
banks are in no way concerned
with
or
bound
by
such
contract(s), even if any reference
whatsoever to such contract(s) is
included
in
the
Credit.
Consequently, the undertaking of
a bank to pay, accept and pay
Draft(s) or negotiate and/or to
fulfil any other obligation under
the Credit, is not subject to
claims or defences by the
Applicant resulting from his
relationships with the Issuing
Bank or the Beneficiary.
b. A Beneficiary can in no
case
avail
himself
of
the
contractual relationships existing
between the banks or between
the Applicant and the Issuing
Bank.”

17.Article 9 lays down the guidelines for the banks regarding
OMP No. 648/2007

Page 10 of 16

their liability of issuing and confirming.

The relevant

portion of Article 9 of UCP 500 is reproduced as below:

“a. An irrevocable Credit
constitutes a definite undertaking
of the Issuing Bank, provided that
the stipulated documents are
presented to the Nominated Bank
or to the Issuing Bank and that
the terms and conditions of the
Credit are complied with:
i. if the credit provides for
sight payment – to pay at sight;
ii. if the credit provides for
deferred payment – to pay on the
maturity date (s) determinable in
accordance with the stipulations
of the Credit;
iii. if the Credit provides for
acceptance:
a. by the Issuing Bank – to
accept Draft(s) drawn by the
Beneficiary on the Issuing Bank
and pay them at maturity,
or
b. by another drawee bankto accept and pay at maturity
Draft(s) drawn by the Beneficiary
on the Issuing Bank in the event
the drawee bank stipulated in the
Credit does not accept Draft(s)
drawn on it, or to pay Draft(s)
accepted but not paid by such
drawee bank at maturity;
iv. if the Credit provides for
negotiation – to pay without
recourse to drawers and/or bona
fide holders, Draft(s) drawn by
the
Beneficiary
and/or
document(s) presented under the
Credit. A Credit should not be
issued available by Draft(s) on the
Applicant.
If
the
Credit
nevertheless calls for Draft(s) on
the Applicant, banks will consider
OMP No. 648/2007

Page 11 of 16

such Draft(s) as an additional
document(s).”
18.Thus, it is clear that respondents No. 2 to 4 are regulated
in their working by various articles of the UCP 500.
Therefore, in case of any irrevocable bank guarantee or
L/C, the buyer cannot obtain injunction against the bank on
the ground that there was breach of the contract by the
seller. Bank has no option but to honour the demand for
encashment if the seller complies with the terms and
conditions of the bank guarantee or L/C.

If the bank is

satisfied on the face of the documents that they are in
conformity with the list of documents mentioned in the
bank guarantee or L/C and there is no discrepancy, the
bank is bound to honour the demand of the seller for
encashment. Bank cannot refuse payment on the ground
that the buyer is claiming that there is breach of contract
nor the bank can decide the question of breach and refuse
payment to the seller. The liability of the bank under the
document is independent of any dispute as to breach of
contract between the seller and the buyer.

19.In Federal Bank Ltd. v. V.M. Jog Engineering Ltd. -

AIR 2000 SC 3166 , it was observed:

“In
OMP No. 648/2007

several

judgments

of

this
Page 12 of 16

Court, it has been held that
Courts ought not to grant
injunction to restrain encashment
of Bank guarantees or Letters of
Credit. Two exceptions have been
mentioned-(i)
fraud
and
(ii)
irretrievable damage.
If the
Plaintiff is prima facie able to
establish that the case comes
within these two exceptions,
temporary injunction under Order
39, Rule 1, C.P.C. can be issued.
It has also been held that the
contract of the Bank guarantee or
the
Letter
of
Credit
is
independent of the main contract
between the seller and the buyer.
This is also clear from Art.3 of the
UCP (1983 Revision). In case of
an irrevocable Bank guarantee or
Letter of Credit the buyer cannot
obtain injunction against the
Banker on the ground that there
was a breach of the contract by
the seller. The Bank is to honour
the demand for encashment if the
seller prima facie complies with
the terms of the Bank Guarantee
or Letter of Credit, namely, if the
seller produces the documents
enumerated
in
the
Bank
Guarantee or Letter of Credit. If
the Bank is satisfied on the face
of the documents that they are in
conformity with the list of
documents mentioned in the Bank
Guarantee or Letter of Credit and
there is no discrepancy, it is
bound to honour the demand of
the seller for encashment. While
doing so it must take reasonable
care. It is not permissible for the
Bank to refuse payment on the
ground that the buyer is claiming
that there is no breach of
contract. Nor can the Bank try to
decide this question of breach at
OMP No. 648/2007

Page 13 of 16

that stage and refuse payment to
the seller. Its obligation under
the document having nothing to
do with any dispute as to breach
of contract between the seller and
the buyer. As to its knowledge of
fraud or forgery, we shall
presently deal with it.”

20.

The observations made in Federal Bank Ltd. (supra)

case were followed by this Court in M/s. Nissho Iwai

Corporation v. Mauria Udyog Pvt. Ltd. & Anr. - 1110
(2004) DLT 620 (DB) and it was observed:

“This
Court
having
considered the material brought
on record can at best observe
that a dispute has arisen between
the parties as to the quality of the
material
supplied
by
the
appellant and the same can only
be settled after a full-fledged
inquiry/ trial. The important
question, however, is as to
whether such a dispute can ipso
facto be termed as a fraud on the
part of the supplier of the goods
thereby disentitling them to
receive the price of the goods so
supplied.
In our opinion, the
answer would be a plain `No'
because at this stage it is difficult
to hold that the material so
supplied was in fact defective or
did
not
conform
to
the
specifications or if it was so what
was the extent and nature of the
defect.
In any case, we are
informed that the petitioner has
now
amended
its
suit
by
incorporating
the
relief
of
OMP No. 648/2007

Page 14 of 16

recovery
of
damages/
compensation. The issue can
appropriately be considered and
answered by the Civil Court only
after the parties have gone to
trial. Thus, looking at the matter
from all possible angles, it cannot
be said that the LOCs in question
would be vitiated by fraud or any
irretrievable damage would be
suffered
by
the
respondent
entitling them an injunction.
Therefore,
we
are
of
the
considered opinion that the
plaintiff-respondent No.1 failed to
make out a prima facie case so as
to entitle them of any restraint
order against the payment of the
LOCs either in full or in part.”

21.Coming back to the facts and circumstances of this case,
petitioner has not alleged any fraud played on it by the
respondent No. 1. No letter was issued to the bankers by
the petitioner informing any fraud having been played upon
it. The bank, therefore, could not have any knowledge of
the fraud, if any.

Present case does not even fall in the

exceptions to Article 3 of UCP 500.

Therefore, present

petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation
Act against the bankers who are not even party to the
consignment agreement and the arbitration clause is not
maintainable and deserves dismissal qua respondents No.
2 to 4.

OMP No. 648/2007

Page 15 of 16

22.To conclude, the claim of the petitioner for restraining the
respondent No. 1 from invoking the L/C No. DIA101180
dated 17.7.2007 is rejected. However, the interest of the
petitioner can be protected by other measures. Hence, it is
ordered that respondent No. 1 shall be entitled to invoke
the said L/C DIA101180 dated 17.7.2007 and receive
payment subject to it furnishing bank guarantee for
1,16,207.76 Euro (Rs. 68,60,906.15 in Indian currency)
within one week to the satisfaction of the Registrar
General.

23.

Petition stands disposed of accordingly.
