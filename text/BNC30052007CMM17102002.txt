B.N.CHATURVEDI, J.
1.
Despite service

of

notice

there

is

no

appearance on behalf of the respondent.
2.

Heard.

3.

Petitioner is aggrieved by an order dated 17 th

Crl. Misc.(M) No.1710/2002

Page 1 of 5

May, 2007 passed by

the learned Addl. Sessions

Judge directing service of 7 days' prior notice on the
respondent in the event of

an FIR being registered

and he being sought to be arrested.
4.

Sh. Aggarwal makes two fold submissions, first
that the court of learned Addl. Sessions Judge, Delhi
at Tis Hazari was not competent to entertain and deal
with the

application for anticipatory bail by the

respondent in view of instructions on administrative
side which provide

that

bail/anticipatory bail

applications under Customs Act, 1962 are to be filed
and disposed of by the courts concerned at Patiala
House only.

Secondly, referring to two decisions of

Supreme Court in Crl. Appeal No.555/2000 and Crl.
Appeal No.1399/2003 Sh. Aggrwal contended that
while disposing

of respondent's application for

anticipatory bail a direction for service of 7 days' prior
notice before effecting arrest in case of registration of
Crl. Misc.(M) No.1710/2002

Page 2 of 5

an FIR could not have been passed by the

learned

Addl. Sessions Judge.
5.

As far as the plea on first count is concerned
no administrative instructions could be brought out
providing for filing and disposal of bail/anticipatory
bail applications in respect of offences punishable
under Customs Act, 1962 by courts of competent
jurisdiction at Patiala House only.

Thus, the order

dated 17th May, 2007 of the learned Addl. Sessions
Judge cannot be interfered with on the ground that
he was not competent to entertain and deal with the
respondent's application for anticipatory bail.
6.

In the context of second plea, the Supreme
Court

in its decision dated 20th July, 2000 in Crl.

Appeal No.555/2000 against an order passed by
Punjab & Haryana High Court on an application for
anticipatory bail requiring service of 7 days' notice in
writing before effecting arrest of the respondent set
Crl. Misc.(M) No.1710/2002

Page 3 of 5

aside the impugned order holding as under :

7.

“We heard Mr. R.N. Trivedi, learned Additional
Solicitor General, Mr. P.S. Misra and Mr. N.
Natarajan, learned
Senior counsel under
instructions. One point in unanimity between
all the counsel is that the impugned order is
an abuse of the process of law, and unless the
order is set aside it might go down as a very
unwholesome precedent.
No refrain from
expressing any further remark on that, and
we presume that learned judge did not think
about the implications of the action adopted
by him. The impugned order is hereby setaside.”
By another order dated 18th November, 2003 in
Crl. Appeal No.1399/2003, the Supreme

Court,

against a similar order requiring service of a week's
notice before effecting arrest passed by this court set
aside the same observing that

once a prayer for

anticipatory bail made by the respondent had been
refused it was not justified to impose a condition like
a prior notice before effecting arrest. The condition of
one week's notice was in the circumstances quashed.

Crl. Misc.(M) No.1710/2002

Page 4 of 5

The aforesaid two decisions thus, clearly disapprove
of condition of service of prior notice before arrest of
the applicant.
The order dated 17th May, 2007 passed by

8.

learned Addl. Sessions Judge being no different in
content, the same is set aside to the extent the same
directs service of 7 days' prior notice before arrest of
the

respondent in the

event

of an FIR

being

registered. The petition is disposed of accordingly.
