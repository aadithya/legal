PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

This is an appeal filed under Section 23 of the Railway

Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 against the order dated 02.05.95 passed
by the learned Railway Claims Tribunal, Delhi.
2.

The appellant Sant Lal Kanhaiya Lal filed a claim

application against the respondent claiming a compensation of
Rs.81,337.50.
3.

The case set up by the appellant was that it had

entrusted a consignment comprising of 219 bags of Urad dal to the
respondent for transport from Vizianagaram station to New Delhi.
FAO No.215/1995

Page No.1 of 6

That the consignment was booked under railway receipt no. 683148
dated 18.05.88.

That the consignment was found in a damaged

condition on 13.08.88 i.e. when the delivery of the consignment was
taken from the respondent. That the damage took place due to
gross

negligence

and

misconduct

of

the

employees

of

the

respondent. That it called upon the respondent to make payment of
the compensation for the loss and issued notice under Section 78-B
of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 and Section 80 of the Code of Civil
Procedure for settlement of the claim. That the market rate of the
Urad dal at the relevant time was Rs.725/- per quintal. That the
respondent accepted its fault but by arbitrarily applying the rate of
the Urad dal at Rs.525/- per quintal sent a cheque of Rs.43,138/towards damages. That the said cheque was accepted under protest
and the respondent is thus liable to pay a balance sum of
Rs.38,200/- (Rs.81,337.50 â€“ Rs.43,138/- = Rs.38,200/-)
4.

From the facts noted above it is clear that the parties

were at variance regarding the rate of the Urad dal at the relevant
time.
5.

Noting the rates of the Urad dal published in the

newspapers (Financial Express and Navbharat Times) the Tribunal
has taken the market rate of the Urad dal at the relevant time as
Rs.567.50/- per quintal and on that basis assessed the damages to
the appellant as Rs.48,206/-. It has been further held that since the
appellant had already a received a sum of Rs.48,138/- it is entitled

to receive a balance sum of Rs.5,068/- from the respondent.
6.

Challenge in the appeal is limited to the price of Urad dal

determined by the Tribunal.
7.

To establish the market rate of the Urad dal at the

relevant time, the appellant examined one Mr.Ram Avtar, the
manager of the appellants' firm, AW-1. The gist of his testimony is
as under:S
No.

Rs.750/- respectively.

8.

Order dated 05.05.93 passed by the learned Tribunal

shows that an opportunity to cross-examine AW-1 was given to the
respondent and that the respondent chose not to examine him.
9.

Per contra, respondent did not lead any evidence on this

aspect of the matter.
10.

Learned Tribunal disbelieved the testimony of the

witness of the appellant. No reasons have been given by the learned
Tribunal to disbelieve his testimony. Instead, the learned Tribunal
preferred to adopt the rates published in the newspapers.
11.

The rates published in the newspapers as adopted by

the Tribunal is an extrinsic evidence.
12.

It is well established principle of law that where intrinsic

evidence is readily available the Courts should rely upon the
intrinsic evidence and eschew extrinsic evidence. (See the decision
of this court reported as S.Harpreet Singh Chawla v Ceat Ltd & Anr

FAO No.215/1995

Page No.4 of 6

134 (2006) DLT 378)
13.

Thus, the learned Tribunal was not right in adopting the

rates published in the newspapers as the market rate of the Urad
dal particularly when the testimony of the witness of the appellant
and documents proved by him in respect of market rate of the Urad
dal at the relevant time has gone unrebutted.
14.

In the light of the evidence adduced by the appellant, I

can safely hold that the market rate of the Urad dal was Rs.725/per quintal at the relevant time i.e. on 13.08.88 when the
consignment was delivered at the destination station.
15.

The damaged contents, as per the Joint Assessment

Report were equivalent to 108.45 bags. Taking the market rate of
Urad dal as Rs.725/- per quintal, the amount for 108.45 bags of Urad
dal comes to Rs.78,626/-.
16.

Noting that the damaged contents were to be used as

Churi, the Tribunal has made a deduction of Rs.13,339/-. Making
said deduction, the compensation payable to the appellant comes to
Rs.65,287/-.
17.

Since the appellant has already received a sum of

Rs.43,138/- from the respondent, the appellant is entitled to receive
a balance sum of Rs.22,149/ together with the interest @7.5% per
annum from the date of the filing of the claim application till the
date of the payment.
18.

Appeal is accordingly allowed as per para 17 above.
