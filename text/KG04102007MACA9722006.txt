KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
*
The only ground arising in the present appeal is that on
the date of accident, the offending vehicle was not insured by the
appellant.

The accident in the present case had occurred on

25.8.1998. The appellant in the written statement at Para 17 has

MAC APP. No. 972/2006

taken an objection that the cover note in favour of the insured
was issued on 31.8.1998 at 3.15 p.m. and premium of Rs.11,305/including service tax of Rs.538/- was received vide receipt
No.0662833 dated 31.8.1998 and the same was presented for
collection vide collection No.2233 dated 31.8.1998. Based on the
said cover note, the policy was issued on 31.9.1998 for the period
31.8.1998 to 30.8.1999 insuring the vehicle bearing registration
No.DL-IP-4395. For better appreciation of the arguments of
counsel for the appellant, the said Para 17 of written statement is
reproduced as under:“17. In reply to para 17 of the petition it is
submitted that the answering respondent had
issued a Cover Note bearing No.144157 dated
31.8.98 at 3.15 p.m. The premium of Rs.11305/including Service Tax of Rs.538/- was received
vide receipt no.0662833 dated 31.8.98 and the
same was presented for collected vide Collection
No.2233 dated 31.8.98. The policy Number was
allotted on 31.9.98 itself as 3132160001836 for
the period 31.8.98 to 30.8.99 insuring vehicle
bearing No.DL-IP-4395 on the representation of
Ms.Hazra Begum, to be the registered owner but
unless it proved that respondent no.1 was holding
a valid driving licence and riving under the
authority and control of the insured. No liability
can be imposed on the answering respondent. -It
is further submitted that the vehicle was not
insured on 25.8.98 vide the aforesaid policy and
the photocopy showing the period as 21.8.98 to
20.8.99 filed in the Court by the petitioner seems
to be ingenuine and forged. The Original in
possession of respondent No.2 be called for

inspection of the Hon'ble Court.”

Mr.P.K. Seth, counsel appearing for the appellant
contends that fraud has been played by the owner/respondent
No.6 by carrying out certain manipulations so as to show that the
policy was valid on the date of the accident. Counsel contends
that fraud vitiates the entire legal proceedings and objection to
this effect can be taken at any stage of the case including at the
stage of appeal. Counsel further contends that the Tribunal has
not returned any finding on the said objection taken by the
appellant/respondent.
Ms. Aruna Mehta, counsel appearing for the respondent
Nos.1 to 5 contends that no such fraud as alleged by the appellant
has been played. Counsel further contends that pursuant to the
directions given by the Tribunal, original policy was placed by the
owner of the said vehicle. Counsel has invited my attention to the
original policy placed on the Trial Court record.

Perusal of the

same shows that the policy bearing No.3132160001836 insuring
the vehicle bearing registration No. DL-IP-4395 was valid for the
period w.e.f. 21.8.1998 till 20.8.1999.

Counsel thus, contends

that the allegations of fraud on the part of the appellant are
preposterous.

MAC APP. No. 972/2006

I have heard learned counsel for the parties.

It is a

cardinal principle of law that parties can tell lie but the documents
cannot. A bare perusal of original policy placed on the Trial Court
record clearly shows that policy bearing No. 3132160001836 is in
the name of the owner of the vehicle Smt.Hazra Begam, W/o
Abdul Rasid. The said vehicle bearing registration No. DLIP 4395,
Model Tata Bus was duly insured against a receipt of net premium
of Rs.11,305/- and the same was valid for the period w.e.f.
21.8.1998 till 20.8.1999. The said policy also bears the collection
number 2233 dated 21.8.1998. Only down below at the column of
the witness, the date of 31.8.1998 somehow appears, which
shows that the said policy was signed at Ghaziabad only on
31.8.1998. Be that as it may, once the original policy placed on
record by the owner shows that the same was valid for the period
w.e.f. 21.8.1998 till 20.8.1999, the authenticity and genuineness
of the same cannot be doubted unless any evidence to the
contrary is led by the insurance company issuing the said policy.
No such evidence was led by the appellant insurance company so
as to prove their contention in the written statement that the
policy in question was valid w.e.f. 31.8.1998 till 30.8.1999. In the
written statement, the objection was taken that the premium of
MAC APP. No. 972/2006

Page 4 of 6

Rs.11,305/- including service tax etc. was received by the insurer
vide receipt No.0662833 dated 31.8.1998 and the same was
presented for collection vide collection No.2233 dated 31.8.1998.
These allegations contained in Para 17 of the written statement
were never substantiated by the appellant.

Rather the original

policy shows that the collection No.2233 was also issued on
21.8.1998 and not on 31.8.1998 as alleged by the appellant in the
written statement.

In the absence of any evidence to the

contrary, the creditworthiness of the said original policy placed on
record by the insured cannot be impinged.
The essence of insurance business is the coverage of
risk by undertaking to indemnify the insured against loss or
damage. The insurers agree to pay the damages arising out of
any accident by taking a chance that no accident might happen.
Motivation of insurance business is that the premium would turn
to be the profit of the business in case no damage occurs. Now,
when the money has been received by the insurance company
and an accident has occurred so equity demands that insurer
should make good the losses.
