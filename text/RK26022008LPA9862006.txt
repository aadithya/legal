JUDGMENT
%
26.02.2008
:
DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)
C.M.No.6669/2006 (Delay)
1.

This application is filed by the appellant praying for condonation of delay

in filing the present appeal. The application seeking for condonation of delay is
contested by the respondents, who have filed their reply raising objection to
the prayer regarding condonation of delay in filing the appeal.
2.

We have heard learned counsel for the parties on the said application. It

is stated by the appellant in his application that the writ petition was disposed
of on 23.02.2005. Admittedly, certified copy of the judgment was received by
the counsel for the appellant on 17.03.2005. A statement is made in the
application that the aforesaid copy was not sent to the appellant by the
counsel and accordingly the appellant was under the bonafide belief that the
writ petition is still pending before the learned Single Judge. He has also stated
that he was not able to contact Mrs. S.T.Siddiqui who was an old lady and was
keeping indifferent health and that in the intervening period she had gone to
abroad live with her son. Further stand taken in the application by the
appellant is that the appellant came to India only in the last week of October,
2005 and tried to enquire about his case, when he was told that the writ
petition has been dismissed by order dated 23.02.2005. He was given a copy of
order on 12.11.2005, but still did not receive the case file from the counsel and,
therefore, the appeal could be filed only on 8.12.2005.
3.

However, the respondents have stated in the reply as against the

aforesaid statement made by the appellant in his application that Mrs.Siddiqui
was seen in the court premises. It is also alleged that there are no particulars

furnished to indicate as to when the counsel had left India and as to when she
had returned back. All other statements made in the application are stated to
be speculative in nature and to be very vague.
4.

We have considered the said pleadings in the light of the submissions

made before us. The negligence of the appellant is writ large. On the basis of
the records, it appears that the appellant has migrated to USA about 14-15
years back and has left the matter at the hands of the counsel. It is also
established from the records that he never bothered to enquire about the
progress of the case. Although the writ petition was disposed of on 23.02.2005
and although admittedly he came to know about the disposal of the said
case, which is apparent from his own admission, in the month of October, 2005,
he did not take any effective steps to get the appeal filed immediately which
ultimately came to be filed on 8.12.2005. Even otherwise, he did not enquire
about the progress of the case during the period of about 7 months from
March to October. No cogent reasons have been given to explain the delay in
between 17.3.2005 to October, 2005. As a litigant, it was his duty and
obligation to pursue his matter through his counsel and, therefore, he was
required to get in touch with his counsel.
5.

In our considered opinion, the explanation sought to be given to justify

the delay of 265 days in filing the appeal is very vague in nature and cannot
be accepted. On going through the records, we are of the considered opinion

that there is a total negligence on the part of the appellant in not pursuing his
case and lack of due diligence in prosecuting the matter.
6.

We, therefore, find no merit in this application and the same is

accordingly dismissed.
LPA 986/2006
In view of the orders passed in C.M.No.6669/2006, the appeal also stands
dismissed.
