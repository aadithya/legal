1.
The petitioner herein was enrolled in the Army as Soldier
Clerk (General Duty) on 20th September, 1980. While on duty the
petitioner sustained injury, viz. a fracture in Head of Radious (left)
when he was playing football match on 25th July, 1996. He was
given medical treatment. The medical board also examined him.
Initially, he was put in low medical category CEE (Temporary) on
16th October, 1996. On 16th January, 1997 his medical category
was upgraded to BEE (Temporary) and with effect from 16th July,
1997 he was placed in medical category BEE (Permanent).
2.

On being placed in medical category BEE (Permanent)

normally the petitioner was to be invalidated out of service.
However, the Army is having a policy whereby an alternate
appointment commensurating with the disability of such an
official is given. This is contained in Army Order 46/80. The very
first para which stipulates the aim of such a policy lays down that
the purpose of this policy is to give sheltered appointment to such
persons who are placed in permanent low medical category. It is
applicable

to

JCOs/other

ranks.

The

petitioner

was

accommodated and retained in service under this policy. In fact,

WP(C) No.7447/2002

Page 2 of 11

the Commanding Officer of the petitioner had given the suitability
certificate dated 23rd October, 2001 certifying that the petitioner
could be suitably employed in his present trade, that is, Clerk
(General Duty) and this alternative employment was treated in
public interest. Part II Serial no. 0/248/2001 dated 20th January,
2001 was also published to this effect.
3.

While the petitioner was continuing in the sheltered

appointment as aforesaid, the general instructions dated 6th
February, 2002 were issued by the Army Head Quarters (Artillery)
for discharge of such low medical category tradesmen whose
strength is more than 98% under the provisions of Army Order
46/80. In view of these instructions, the discharge order dated 1st
July, 2002 was passed in respect of persons whose names
appeared in the appendix attached to the said discharge order.
The name of the petitioner also found mentioned therein. This
order, inter alia, stated that the retention of permanent low
medical category Shape 2 or 3 personnel in service was governed
by the Army Order 46/80 and as some of the trades/categories in
the Regiment of Artillery had exceeded the sanctioned strength,
the persons named in the appendix, who have been placed in

WP(C) No.7447/2002

Page 3 of 11

permanent low medical category Shape 2 or 3, were to be
discharged with effect from 30th November, 2002 (AN).

The

specific reason assigned in this order dated 1st July, 2002 was in
the following terms:
“On being placed and low medical category, further

retention in service is not considered necessary as
per AO 46/80 since the strength of their
trades/categories has exceeded the sanctioned
strength.”

4.

The discharge was treated under Army Rule 13(3) as it was

categorically mentioned in the said discharge order dated 1st July,
2002 that the cause of discharge would be recorded in the
discharge roll as under:
“Discharge being placed in permit medical category

lower than SHAPE 1 and not upto the prescribed
military physical standard under Item I (III) of the
table annexed to Army Rule 13(3)”

5.

The petitioner on receipt of the said discharge order filed the

present writ petition on 15th November, 2002 challenging this
discharge as illegal on various grounds. The show cause notice
was issued in this writ petition on 22nd November, 2002. The
respondent was granted three days time to file the counter

WP(C) No.7447/2002

Page 4 of 11

affidavit as the petitioner was proposed to be discharged with
effect from 30th November 2002. The matter again came up for
hearing on 29th November, 2002. However, since the counter
affidavit was not filed, the court granted the stay of operation of
the impugned orders dated 1st July, 2002 and 2nd November, 2002
till the next date of hearing. This stay order was continued from
time to time which is still under operation and because of the stay
order the petitioner is still in service.
6.

We may point out at this stage that as the petitioner was

retained in service his case was considered for further promotion
and he was given the rank of Naib Subedar with effect from 10th
February, 1999.

Normally, as Naib Subedar the tenure of

incumbent is 26 years. There can be extention of service by two
years in appropriate cases. Thus, as Naib Subedar the petitioner
could continue in service upto 30th September, 2006. As the
petitioner continued in service because of the stay order granted
by this court, his name was considered for promotion to the next
higher rank, namely, Subedar. As per the extant rules, before the
date of retirement in the particular grade, the official is to be
considered for promotion. Since the petitioner became eligible for

WP(C) No.7447/2002

Page 5 of 11

promotion to the post of Subedar in the year 2003, the promotion
board considered his name and placed him in the select panel for
the year 2003. However it is not given effect to as yet, in view of
the pendency of this writ.
7.

If the petitioner is granted promotion as Subedar he gets

further tenure of two years and would continue, in normal course,
till September, 2008.

The petitioner had thus sought an

amendment of the writ petition which was allowed, allowing the
petitioner to agitate the issue about his next promotion.
8.

Having regard to the aforesaid factual position, two issues

arise for consideration, namely, (1) whether the discharge of the
petitioner from service vide order dated 1st April, 2002 was proper
and legal? (2) In case answer to the first issue is in the affirmative,
whether the petitioner is entitled to promotion as Subedar, having
regard to the medical category in which he is placed?
Issue No.1
9.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that

there was deficiency of officials in the rank of the petitioner as
admitted in the counter affidavit itself and, therefore, there was
no occasion to discharge the petitioner from service.
WP(C) No.7447/2002

In this

Page 6 of 11

behalf, she has referred to counter affidavit dated 5th March,
2003, wherein the respondents have stated that as on 1st March,
2001, the Regiment of Artillery was facing deficiency of 609 clerks
and to make up that deficiency, the applications were invited
from eligible volunteers from other trades to re-muster into clerk
trade. It is further stated by the respondents in the counter
affidavit that 32 individuals from other trades were qualified for
re-mustering

into

clerk

category

and

their

training

were

conducted from 6th May, 2002 to 19th October, 2002 at Artillery
Centre, Hyderabad. This averment is repeated in subsequent
counter affidavit dated 21st November, 2005 filed to the amended
petition.
10.

It could not be disputed by learned counsel for the

respondent that if there was no surplus staff in the category of the
petitioner and rather there was deficiency of the officials in the
said rank, the petitioner could not have been discharged.

It is

apparent inasmuch as Army Order 46/80 was pressed into service
as per which if some of the trades/categories in the regiment of
artilery

had

exceeded

sanctioned

strength,

such

of

those

personnel who are in permanent low medical SHAPE II or III could

WP(C) No.7447/2002

Page 7 of 11

be discharged.

Thus the discharge order predicates on the

surplus age whereas, as pointed out by learned counsel for the
respondent that there was in fact deficiency of the personnel in
the rank of the petitioner, as per the averments made in the
counter affidavit itself.
11.

Faced

with

this

situation,

learned

counsel

for

the

respondents, at this stage, tried to argue that there was no
deficiency of manpower in the trade in which the petitioner was
commissioned and in fact, there was surplus. However, we are
not inclined to agree with this submission of learned counsel for
the respondents in view of the specific averments made in the
counter affidavit by the respondents themselves as noted above.
We cannot lose sight of the fact that not only it is stated in the
counter affidavit that there was deficiency of 609 officers, but also
it is mentioned by the respondents that in order to cover up the
said deficiency the exercise of re-mustering the employees of
other trade to the clerk trade was also undertaken. Such steps
would be taken if there is deficiency and not when there is
surplus. It may also be mentioned that in the counter affidavit
filed in November, 2005, the respondents after mentioning that

WP(C) No.7447/2002

Page 8 of 11

the applications were invited from eligible candidates of other
trades for re-mustering into the clerk trade to make up the
deficiency, have specifically stated the reasons because of which
some trades/categories became surplus whereas in the clerk trade
there was deficiency. We reproduce that portion of the counter
affidavit :
“The action to remuster other personnel into clerk

(General Duty) was taken well before when the
strength clerk trade was deficient and other trades
becoming surplus in the Regiment of Artillery. The
main reason where some trades/categories became
surplus are:
a)Due to withholding of clerks due to automation of
Artillery Records
b)Further decrease in authorization of clerks in other
establishments
c) Lifting of suppression of manpower in the Army and
release of additional recruitment demand which
started materializing during 2001/02.”
12.

We, therefore, cannot allow the respondents now to urge

that there was surplus in clerk trade and would proceed on the
aforesaid statement made by the respondents themselves in the
counter affidavit, namely, there was deficiency of officials in the
clerk trade.
13.

It hardly needs to be emphasized when there was deficiency

WP(C) No.7447/2002

Page 9 of 11

in the trade to which the petitioner belongs, there was no
occasion to discharge him from service having regard to his
medical category which was only BEE (P2). The discharge order is
set aside on this ground.
Issue No.2
14.

The next question which arises for consideration is as to

what would be the effect of putting the petitioner in the select
panel for promotion to the post of Subedar in the year 2000.
Since in normal course the petitioner would have completed his
tenure as Naib Subedar in September, 2006, therefore, the issue
before us is as to whether the petitioner would have been entitled
to promotion as Subedar had there been no discharge order.
15.

It is conceded by learned counsel for the respondents, on

instructions, that when the petitioner was in the select list qua the
rank of Subedar, he would have been granted the promotion to
the said post in normal course irrespective of his medical
category since he was in low medical category BEE (P2) and as
the said medical category does not disentitle a person to get his
promotion.
16.

Under these circumstances, we make the rule absolute and

WP(C) No.7447/2002

Page 10 of 11

allow the writ petition with a direction to the respondents to give
effect to the select list, wherein the name of the petitioner was
placed for promotion to the post of Subedar, from the date he was
otherwise entitled to such a promotion. As a consequence he
should be allowed to continue in such post till September, 2008.
The petitioner shall also be entitled to be considered for further
promotions in accordance with law. Necessary order shall be
passed in this regard within eight weeks from today.
