Government vehicle, that is, during the course of discharging the
Government duty. The injury was diagnosed as “covnea opacity.
On 14th October, 1988 Mr.N.S.Dayal, Commandant, after receiving
a letter from the father of the petitioner, requested Dr.L.C. Gupta,
Additional Chief Medical Officer, HQ DG BSF, R.K.Puram, New
Delhi, to help the petitioner in getting treatment in one of the
Government hospitals in Delhi. On 4th September, 1989 the case
of the petitioner was referred to I/D (MD) Frontier Hospital, TCM
for further investigation and treatment by the Medical Officer.
The report dated 7th September, 1989 reveals, “There is no
possible treatment in Agartala, Tripura Hospital.

Keratoplasty

facilities are not available at Tripura Hospital.”
2.

The petitioner tendered resignation vide his application

dated 23rd November, 1989 which was accepted with immediate
effect from 6th March, 1990.

His period of absence from 24 th

October, 1989 to 6th March, 1990 was regularised as EOL without
pay.
3.

Thereafter, the petitioner submitted an application for

revocation of discharge order and he was permitted to join duty
within fifteen days from the date of the above-said letter dated
2nd August, 1990. However, he actually joined the duty on 17th

the

following

recommendations, “As per the advice of RMC and condition of
patient he requires kertoplasty which is possible at Delhi or any
other hospital. These facilities are not available in Tripura.”
4.

On 4th July, 1991 the father of the petitioner made a request

to the respondent to post the petitioner near Delhi for petitioner's
treatment. On 15th July, 1991 the request made for transfer to
Delhi was turned down by the respondents. On 5th October, 1991
a show cause notice was issued to the petitioner by respondent
No. 3.

On 18th October, 1991 the petitioner's leave was

sanctioned but in the same order he was removed from service
on the ground that he had deserted the Army.
5.

The petitioner has filed the present writ petition with the

prayers that the order of termination dated 18th October, 1991 be
set aside, petitioner be reinstated with full back wages, and
continuity of service with effect from the date of his termination,
the respondent be directed to reimburse the cost of treatment of
ailment and award a lump sum compensation in the sum of
Rs.50,000/- and to issue directions to the respondents to adjust
the petitioner on a light duty job at BSF Head Quarter at Delhi or
WP(C) No.2042/1998

at a nearby BSF station and get the petitioner treated at a
specialised hospital with advanced technology and equipments.
6.

The respondent has defended the termination order dated

18th October, 1991 and listed the following grounds.

The

petitioner was discharged in the year 1991 but the writ petition
was filed in the year 1998. It was prayed that the writ petition be
dismissed on the ground of delays and laches.

The petitioner

himself preferred to take treatment from a famous Doctor in
Rohtak Medical College. He was accordingly granted leave during
which period he got himself admitted in Krishna Lal Jaloan Eye
Hospital, Haryana of his own accord.

In that hospital he

underwent optical Tridoctomy operation in right eye. Thereafter,
he did not report for duty on expiry of leave and from his home
town he submitted a letter dated 23rd November, 1989 requesting
therein for discharge from service. Subsequently, he was taken
back to the above-said service with effect from 17th October,
1990.

After rejoining, he again applied for leave and he was

sanctioned 30 days Earned Leave and 6 days JP (joining period)
from 20th May, 1991 to 24th June, 1991. At that time, only 31 days
leave were at his credit. The petitioner reported from leave in
time but again deserted from Unit line on 1st July, 1991. Two call
WP(C) No.2042/1998

Page 4 of 10

letters were issued to him to report for duty but the needful was
not done. A show cause notice was also issued but it did not
produce the desired result.

Ultimately, the petitioner was

removed from service with effect from 18th October, 1991 in
accordance with Section 11(3) of the BSF Act read with BSF Rules
22 and 177.
7.

We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.

The

learned counsel for the petitioner vehemently argued that the
respondent committed an egregious mistake in not transferring
the petitioner to Delhi. It was argued that the hospital's Unit MI
Room did not have the facility to treat the petitioner as is
apparent from the detailed medical advice referred above. The
petitioner had to tender resignation under present circumstances
for medical treatment.

It

was argued that under these

circumstances no fault can be attributed to the petitioner.
Counsel for the petitioner argued that the petitioner will not pray
for back wages.
8.

We are of the considered view that there is an inordinate

delay in filing the present writ petition. It must be borne in mind
that the petitioner did not send response to the above-said two
call letters and show cause notice. It is also pertinent to note that
WP(C) No.2042/1998

the petitioner himself preferred to take treatment from a famous
Doctor in Rohtak, Medical College.
granted as prayed.

His leave application was

He was treated in Krishna Lal Jaloan Eye

Hospital, Haryana as per his own desire. He applied for earned
leave again but no earned leave was found at his credit, yet he
was granted 30 days H.P.L.

Again, he remained absent from 25 th

October, 1989 to 17th October, 1990 and that period was treated
as 'Dies Non'.
9.

Moreover, no explanation was given as to why did he desert

the BSF for more than seven years.

He could have asked for

further leave. He could have asked for leave without payment of
salary. He could have requested the respondents to post him at
Delhi as treatment in Imphal and Rohtak did not ring the bell.
There is no evidence, worth name, to show that from 18 th
October, 1991 till the date of filing of the writ petition before this
Court, he was suffering from an eye disease or was treated
anywhere else. The delay in approaching the Court is fatal. In a
recent authority reported in Shiv Dass Vs. Union of India and Ors.,
AIR 2007 SC 1330, it was held,
5. Normally, in the case of belated approach writ
petition has to be dismissed. Delay or laches is
one of the factors to be borne in mind by the

High
Courts
when
they
exercise
their
discretionary powers under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India, 1950 (in short the
'Constitution'). In an appropriate case the High
Court may refuse to invoke its extraordinary
powers if there is such negligence or omission on
the part of the applicant to assert his right as
taken in conjunction with the lapse of time and
other circumstances, causes prejudice to the
opposite party. Even where fundamental right is
involved the matter is still within the discretion of
the Court as pointed out in Durga Prasad v. Chief
Controller of Imports and Exports and Ors., AIR
1970 SC 769. Of course, the discretion has to be
exercised judicially and reasonably.
7. It was stated in State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal
and Ors., AIR 1987 SC 251, that the High Court in
exercise of its discretion does not ordinarily
assist the tardy and the indolent or the
acquiescent and the lethargic. If there is
inordinate delay on the part of the petitioner and
such delay is not satisfactorily explained, the
High Court may decline to intervene and grant
relief in exercise of its writ jurisdiction. It was
stated that this rule is premised on a number of
factors. The High Court does not ordinarily permit
a belated resort to the extraordinary remedy
because it is likely to cause confusion and public
inconvenience and bring in its train new
injustices, and if writ jurisdiction is exercised
after unreasonable delay, it may have the effect
of inflicting not only hardship and inconvenience
but also injustice on third parties. It was pointed
out that when writ jurisdiction is invoked,
unexplained delay coupled with the creation of
third party rights in the meantime is an
important factor which also weighs with the High
Court in deciding whether or not to exercise such
jurisdiction.

Now let us turn to the merits of this case. A Division Bench

of this Court in WP(C) No.1714/2006 titled as Ex-Naik Charan
Singh Vs. Union of India and Others decided on 13th July, 2006,
was pleased to hold,
“6. From the service record of the petitioner, it
is apparent that an opportunity to reply to the
charge-sheet of unauthorised absence for the
period from 23.6.89 to 14.2.90 was not availed of
and the authorites having left with no alternative
had passed the order of dismissal from service
under Rule 177.
Unauthorised absence is a
serious misconduct and in fact where no
reasonable cause is shown and a member of the
Force remains unauthorisedly absent without
leave or sanction of the competent authority, it
would be termed as a misconduct of a grave
nature. This was held to be even true in the
cases of State Police and in the case of Ex.
Constable Satnam Singh v. State of Punjab 1997
(3) RSJ 353 where the court referred to various
judgments of the Supreme Court including the
judgment in the case of The State of Punjab and
Others v. Ram Singh Ex. Constable JT 1992 (4) SC
253. Thus, it cannot be said that absence of the
petitioner could not be the foundation for
dismissing him from service. Even before the
court, no explanation whatsoever has been
rendered by the petitioner for his prolonged
unauthorised absence except that he was having
a back problem which again is not supported by
any definite medical record.
The
petitioner
has also failed to explain why couldn't he appear
or get in touch with any of the units in and
around his own State. In the order itself, the
absence for the relevant period has been treated
WP(C) No.2042/1998

Page 8 of 10

as extraordinary leave without pay which will not
amount to condoning the offence as it has been
done primarily for the purposes of regularisation
of record and dues payable to the petitioner in
accordance with rules. Reference can also be
made in this behalf to the judgment of the Punjab
& Haryana High Court in the case of Ex.H.C.
Gagan Bhaskar v. State of Punjab CWP
10245/2001 decided on 2.8.2001. Thus, in our
considered view, the petitioner is not entitled to
the relief on this account. Though the petitioner
has not even filed the copy of the order of
dismissal but having gone through the record, we
do not think that the proceedings dated 25th May,
1990 call for any judicial intervention.”
11.

The learned counsel for the respondent also drew our

attention to a judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in WP(C)
No. 6577/2002 titled as Ex.Constable Akhilesh Kumar Vs. The
Director General, BSF and Ors. decided on 21st March, 2006,
wherein the Division Bench has observed,
“In a recent decision of the Supreme Court in
State of Rajasthan & Anr. v. Mohammed Ayub
Naz reported in 2006 I AD (SC) 308 the Supreme
Court after referring to many other precedencfes
has held that absenteeism from office for prolong
period of time without prior permission by the
Government servant has become a principal
cause of indiscipline which have greatly affected
various Government services. It is also held that
in order to mitigate the rampant absenteeism
and willful absence from service without
intimation to the Government the Government
has promulgated a rule that if the government
servant remains willfully absent for a period
WP(C) No.2042/1998

Page 9 of 10

exceeding one month and if the charge of willful
absence from duty is proved against him, he may
be removed from service. The Supreme Court
held that the order of removal from service
passed in the said case was the only proper
punishment to be awarded in view of the fact that
Government servant was absent from duty for
long
period
without
intimation
to
the
Government.”
12.

The whole gamut of fact and circumstances detailed above

leans on the side of the respondents.

The writ petition is

therefore dismissed, but the parties are left to bear their own
costs.
