The petitioner No.1 (CFA Institute) is a non-stock corporation

incorporated under the laws of Virginia (USA) and has its office at 560, Ray C.
Hunt Drive, P.O. Box 3668, Charlottesville, VA-22903-0668, USA.
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

The

Page No.1 of 31

petitioner No.1 claims to be a global professional association comprised of
more than 89,000 individual members and 134 member societies across the
world. Individual members either hold the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA)
Designation or are active in the investment business.

For the purpose of

becoming members or being awarded the CFA Designation, individuals must
have at least four years of professional work experience in the investment
profession. As per the petitioners, the CFA Designation was first awarded in
1963 and is a designation of professional excellence in the global investment
community. According to the petitioners, employers and investors throughout
the world consider the CFA designation awarded by the petitioner No.1 as the
definitive standard for measuring investment analysis competence and integrity.

2.

The attainment of the CFA Designation requires the passing of three

levels of tests all conducted by the petitioner No.1. As stated in the petition, the
petitioner No.1 provides testing on one day in June for all three levels and in
December of each year for the first level alone. These tests are conducted in
rented quarters using local proctors and support with the attendance of one of
the petitioner No.1's employees to monitor the quality. It is stated that the
petitioner No.1 is a testing and certifying organisation conducting a self-study
course with tests for its candidates on only two days a year in India. It is
categorically stated that there are no ongoing educational activities requiring a
local collaborating partner.
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

3.

It is further stated on behalf of the petitioners that the course of study for

each of the three levels is suggested and a body of knowledge from which the
testing is drawn is provided.

Each person enrolling for the examination,

however, is left to determine his own method of preparation. No instructional
programmes are offered by the petitioner No.1. After the passing of the three
levels of tests / examinations, an individual aspiring to attain the CFA
Designation must further prove his or her professional experience in the
financial field and provide professional references which are closely examined
by the petitioner No.1. The individual must submit to ethical rules of the
petitioner No.1 and pay professional dues to retain the CFA Designation.
According to the petitioners, passing of the examination alone is not sufficient
for the award of the CFA Designation. For it may be revoked for failure to pay
the required membership dues or for ethical violations.

4.

The petitioner No.2 is a candidate for the CFA Charter / Certification

and is a citizen of India. He is planning to take the level three examination on
03.06.2007 from the Delhi Centre. Both the petitioners are aggrieved by the
order dated 18.05.2007 passed by the All India Institute of Technical Education
(AICTE). The said order dated 18.05.2007 passed by the AICTE reads as
under:-

CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

“I am directed to refer to the show cause notice issued by this
Council vide letter No.37-3/Legal/AICTE/2005 dated
22.03.2007 as to why action should not be taken against your
institution for violation of AICTE regulations dated 16th May
2005 for entry and operation of foreign university/institution
imparting Technical Education in India. Your responses
dated 02.04.2007, 09.04.2007 and 10.04.2007 received in
reply to the show cause notice that the CFA programme
conducted by CFA Institute do not come under the purview of
AICTE have been considered by the Council and found not
acceptable since Technical Education programmes/courses at
all levels including certificate, diploma, post diploma, degree,
post graduate and research of any duration if they are
conducting directly or in collaboration with a foreign
university / institution require AICTE approval. All such
foreign universities / institutions must obtain AICTE approval
as per the regulations notified.
Since your institution has failed to obtain mandatory approval
from AICTE under the Regulations notified by the council
vide notification No.37-3/Legal/2005 dated 16.05.2005, the
Council has no option but to initiate necessary action against
your institution.
You are therefore advised to cease the operation of your
institution in respect of conduct of CFA programme in India
with immediate effect. The concerned authorities including
State Govt./UT are being advised to take appropriate
measures to shut down / close down operation of your
institution by invoking appropriate provisions of civil and
criminal laws applicable in such cases.”

5.

In effect, the impugned order dated 18.05.2007 stipulates that the

petitioner No.1 shall cease all operations in respect of the conduct of the CFA
Programme in India with immediate effect. Directions have been issued to all
the concerned authorities, including State Governments and Union Territories
to take appropriate measures to shut down / close down operations of the
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

petitioner No.1 by invoking appropriate provisions of civil and criminal laws
applicable in such cases. The reason given for this order is that the petitioner
No.1 failed to obtain mandatory approval from AICTE under the regulations
notified by the counsel vide Notification 37-3/Legal/2005 dated 16.05.2005.

6.

Mr Shanti Bhushan, the learned senior counsel who appeared on behalf

of the petitioners, submitted that the examination to be conducted on
03.06.2007 is a global examination across a large number of countries. The
centres in India are at Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai and Mumbai and approximately
7,000 students are to appear for the said examination in India alone. He
submits that the impugned order has resulted in stultifying the entire process
and these 7,000 students would not be permitted to take the examination if the
impugned order is allowed to operate. He submitted that the impugned order is
wholly without jurisdiction and beyond the scope and ambit of the powers of
the AICTE. He drew my attention to Section 2 (g) and Section 2 (h) of The All
India Council for Technical Education Act, 1987 (hereinafter referred to as 'the
said Act') which define 'technical education and 'technical institution'. The said
provisions read as under:“2.

“Technical education” means programmes of

management, pharmacy and applied arts and crafts
and such other programme or areas as the Central
Government may, in consultation with the
Council, by notification in the Official Gazette,
declare;
“Technical institution” means an institution, not

programmes of technical education, and shall
include such other institutions as the Central

xxxx

xxxx”

Mr Shanti Bhushan contended that the petitioner No.1 is not conducting

any programme of education, research and training in India. The petitioner
No.1 is not concerned with engineering, technology, architecture, town
planning, management, pharmacy and applied arts and crafts. The petitioner
No.1 is an organisation of professionals who give a designation of CFA to
deserving and meritorious individuals based on the system indicated above. It
does not have a programme of education, research or training.

It merely

conducts tests as a part of its designation process. He further submitted that the
CFA programme does not mean a programme of education, research and
training in any of the fields specified in Section 2 (g) of the Act.

CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

8.

Mr Shanti Bhushan also submitted that the petitioner No.1 has no

presence in India whatsoever and cannot fall within the definition of technical
institution. In fact, it is not an institution at all in India. It is definitely not a
university nor does it offer courses or programmes of technical education. Nor
has it otherwise been notified by the Central Government in the official gazette.
The sum and substance of Mr Shanti Bhushan's submissions is that the
petitioner No.1 is neither a technical institution nor does it impart technical
education and, therefore, it is wholly beyond the scope of the said Act which, as
the preamble itself suggests, is an Act to provide for the establishment of an All
India Council for Technical Education with a view to the proper planning and
coordinated development of technical education system throughout the country,
the promotion of qualification improvements of such education in relation to
planned qualitative growth and the regulation and proper maintenance of norms
and standards in the technical education system and for matters connected
therewith.

9.

Mr Amarender Sharan, the learned ASG who appeared on behalf of the

AICTE, submitted that the petitioner was clearly within the purview of the said
Act and had to comply with the requirements thereunder. He referred to the
AICTE regulations for entry and operations of Foreign Universities in India
imparting technical education, 2005.

Objectives 'b' and 'd' of the said

regulations read as under:CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

“b.

d.

10.

To systematize the operation of Foreign Universities /
Institutions already providing training and other
educational services including that of coaching of
students, in India leading to award of degree and diploma
in technical education, either on their own or in
collaboration with an Indian educational institution, under
any mode of delivery system such as conventional /
formal, non-formal and distance mode.
To enforce accountability for all such educational
activities by Foreign Universities / Institutions in India.”

Mr Sharan laid particular emphasis on the last phrase in objective 'b' to

the effect- 'any mode of delivery system such as conventional / formal, nonformal and distance mode'. He submitted that even distance learning through
the Internet or otherwise was covered by the regulations and it did not matter
that the petitioner No.1 was not located in India. He referred to objective 'd'
mentioned above to emphasise that the enforcement of accountability in respect
of all educational activities by Foreign Universities / Institutions in India were
entirely covered within the ambit of the said regulations.

11.

Mr Sharan referred to the various documents which he had culled out

from the Internet with regard to the prospectus of the CFA. He referred to them
to indicate that they were definitely involved in an educational activity as they
were offering programmes and the CFA Programme was referred to as the
curriculum and examination programme. He also referred to the Chairman's
letter which describes the CFA Programme by referring to it as “our flagship
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

educational programme, the CFA Programme is recognised for its practical,
global curriculum and its high standard of practice”. He submitted that while
the petitioners stated that they do not provide any study material, the CFA
website with reference to the curriculum reveals that a committee of practicing
CFA Charter-holders, in conjunction with CFA Institute staff, designs the
curriculum to deliver the Candidate Body of Knowledge. The curriculum is
delivered in a candidate friendly, integrated form at each level of the exam
program. He referred to similar other statements contained in the website to
indicate that the petitioner No.1 has a regular curriculum and, therefore,
according to him, it will definitely fall within the programme of education as
appearing in Section 2 (g) of the said Act. He also submitted the topics
mentioned under Section 2 (g) included “management” which would cover the
field of activity of the petitioner No.1. Therefore, it was contended by Mr
Sharan that prima facie the activities of the petitioner No.1 fall within the said
Regulations of 2005 and, consequently, within the scope and ambit of the said
Act. He submitted that, at this stage, taking a prima facie view, the impugned
order dated 18.05.2007 cannot be faulted.

12.

The rejoinder on behalf of the petitioners was submitted by Mr Valmiki

Mehta, senior advocate (in the absence of Mr Shanti Bhushan on 30.5.2007).
He submitted that for 20 years, i.e., from 1987, the examinations have been
held each year in India as well as all over the world. He submitted that the Act
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

and the regulations do not contemplate a body such as the petitioner No.1 to be
within the purview of the AICTE. He referred to the Application Form which
is required to be submitted by Foreign Universities / Foreign Institutions
imparting technical education in India under the said Regulations of 2005. Part
I of the Application Form deals with the details of Foreign Universities /
Foreign Institutions. Part II pertains to information about the facilities for the
proposed programme. This part is applicable to the Foreign Universities /
Institutions wishing to start their own campus in India directly. Part III of the
Application Form pertains to information about the collaborating partner in
India. This part is clearly and admittedly inapplicable and, therefore, need not
be referred to. According to the AICTE, the petitioner No.1 ought to have
applied under the Regulations of 2005 and Part II of the Application Form
would be relevant for its purposes. Referring to Part II of the Application
Form, Mr Mehta submitted that it related to a Foreign University / Institution
wishing to start its own campus in India directly by itself. He submitted that
this indicated that “a brick and mortar” institution in India was contemplated.
The petitioner No.1 has no such “brick and mortar” campus in India either by
itself or through any collaborating partner. He referred to paragraph 3 of Part
III of the Application Form which pertains to details of the applicant society /
trust. He submitted that the petitioner No.1 is neither a society under the
Societies Registration Act nor is it a registered trust.

CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

13.

He then referred to paragraph 5 of Part II of the Application Form which

requires the applicant to provide the name and address of the proposed
institution at the “permanent site with pin code”. The applicant is also required
to state clearly whether the proposed site falls within the the corporation limits
of Metropolitan City / State Capital / District Headquarters / Rural Area. He
submits that the petitioner No.1 does not have any permanent site in India and,
therefore, would not fall within the category of institutions contemplated by the
regulation. Mr Mehta also referred to paragraph 7 of Part II of the Application
Form which relates to details of the land which is to be utilised for the
exclusive use of the proposed institution at the permanent site. He submits that
the petitioner No.1 does not have any land in India nor does it propose to have
any land. There are other references also, such as paragraph 10 (which relates
to building) which include laboratories, class rooms, drawing halls, workshops,
library, administrative block, hostel etc. He submits that the Application Form
itself indicates that the Foreign Institution must exist in India, having land and
buildings in India and imparting regular education, research and training. The
regulations have been issued for regulating entry and operation of the Foreign
Universities / Institutions for imparting technical education in India.

The

petitioner No.1 does not impart any technical education in India. It does not
have any physical address in India. Nor does it have any land or buildings or
class rooms or campus. Therefore, even as per the Regulations, an institution
such as the petitioner No.1 is not at all contemplated and is, therefore, beyond
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

the provisions and scope of the said Regulations and, consequently, of the said
Act. He further submitted that as per the AICTE Hand Book for Approval
Process for Establishment of New Technical Institutions and Introduction of
Additional Course(s) / Increase in Intake / Extension of Approval in Existing
Institutions, there are only three types of management courses. They are -- (1)
Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM), (2) Post Graduate Dimploma
in Business Management (PGDBM) and (3) Master in Business Administration
(MBA). Mr Mehta submitted that the CFA Programme does not fall under any
of these categories and, therefore, even the argument of Mr Sharan that CFA
falls within the category of “Management” cannot be sustained.

14.

Mr Mehta also referred to the Supreme Court decision in the case of

Sole Trustee Lok Shikshana Trust v. Commissioner of Income Tax, Mysore:
1976 (1) SCC 254 to submit that the word 'education' as used in Section 2 (15)
of the Income Tax Act, 1961 was held to connote “the process of training and
developing the knowledge, skill mind and character of students by formal
schooling”. He submitted that the CFA Programme does not involve any
process of training or formal schooling.

It merely tests the aptitude and

proficiency of the applicants and thereafter considers them to be eligible for
being designated as CFAs. He reiterated that the CFA Programme involves a
self-study course with suggested material.

CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

15.

Considering the arguments advanced by the counsel for the parties, at

this prima facie stage, it does appear to me that the petitioner No.1 has a good
case. To my mind, the petitioner No.1 does not fall within the expression
“technical institution” as contemplated in Section 2 (h) of the said Act. Nor do
I feel, at this stage, that the petitioner is imparting “technical education” as
contemplated under Section 2 (g) of the said Act.

Even the application

prescribed under the 2005 Regulations indicates that the type of institution
which was in contemplation was one where a campus was sought to be set up in
India having, to borrow Mr Mehta's expression, “a brick and mortar” existence
in India. Therefore, I am of the view that the petitioner No.1 has been able to
establish a good prima facie case. As regards the balance of convenience, I
find that that is also in favour of the petitioners. For over 20 years, the
examination has been conducted in India and globally.

The order dated

18.05.2007 will, if permitted to operate, stultify the process for the
examinations to be held on 03.06.2007. The applicants who have laboured and
studied hard for the said examinations would be “shot down” in mid-flight, as it
were. Seven thousand applicants are to take their examinations on 03.06.2007.
If the order impugned herein is permitted to operate, they will not be able to
take the examinations. On the other hand no prejudice would be caused to
AICTE or ICFAI. No campus has been set up. No classrooms have been set
up. No instruction or training has been provided. The applicants have already
paid their fees, and have already gone through the self-study stage, perhaps,
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

utilising the suggested body of material. The only other step is for them to take
the examinations. Therefore, the balance of convenience is definitely in favour
of permitting the petitioners to take the examinations. It may be noted that the
petitioner No.1 as well as the petitioner No.2 are not concerned with whether
AICTE recognises the CFA Designation or not.

16.

In case the petitioner No.1 is not permitted to conduct the examination

and the petitioner No.2 is not permitted to take the examination, irreparable
damage would have been caused to them if, ultimately, they succeed in this
petition. On the other hand, no prejudice would be caused to the Respondent
(AICTE) if the examination is held. Therefore, in my view, the operation of the
impugned order ought to be stayed till the writ petition is decided to the extent
that the petitioner No.1 is permitted to go ahead with the examination in India
on 03.06.2007.

17.

But the matter does not rest here. This case has a chequered history.

The petitioner No.1 offered the Chartered Financial Analyst Designation for the
first time in 1963. In India, it became known around 1985-89, through a
licencee. The first set of examinations, as stated above, were conducted in
India in 1987 and the first CFA designation awarded to Indian applicants was in
1989.

Sometime in 1997, the petitioner No1's erstwhile licencee and the

petitioner No.1 parted ways. The erstwhile licencee started calling itself under
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

the name and style of ICFAI (Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of
India). In 2004, a suit being CS(OS) No.210/2004 was filed. The petitioner
herein was the plaintiff No.2 in that suit and the ICFAI (Institute of Chartered
Financial Analyst of India) was the defendant No.1. The suit was pertaining to
trademarks. By a detailed order dated 04.08.2006 passed in IA No.11547/2004,
a learned single Judge of this court granted an interim injunction in favour of
the petitioner No.1 restraining ICFAI as well as the Council of Chartered
Financial Analysts from using the petitioner No.1's trademarks.

18.

In January-February, 2007, the ICFAI Tripura University was instituted

through a State Legislation. The said University was sponsored by the ICFAI.
In March, 2007, the ICFAI University filed a writ petition before the High
Court of Gauhati (Agartala Bench) being WP(C) 73/2007 against, inter alia, the
petitioner No.1 and the respondent (AICTE). The ICFAI University, inter alia,
sought a mandamus against the AICTE to conduct an inquiry into the affairs
and operations of the petitioner No.1 and to take immediate suitable and
appropriate action thereon. Essentially, it was a petition seeking directions to
the AICTE to stop the activities of the petitioner No.1 in India. By an order
dated 12.03.2007, the Gauhati High Court directed the AICTE to examine the
allegations against the petitioner No.1 and to take necessary action. Thereafter,
a show cause notice was issued by the AICTE to the petitioner No.1. They
filed a reply which culminated in the final order dated 18.05.2007, which is
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

impugned herein. In the meanwhile, the matter had come up before the Gauhati
High Court on 30.04.2007 when it was renotified to be listed on 28.05.2007.

19.

After the receipt of the order dated 18.05.2007, the present writ petition

was filed challenging the same before this Court on 24.05.2007.

On

25.05.2007, the matter came up for admission before this court and part
arguments were heard and it was renotified for further arguments on
29.05.2007. However, before further arguments could be heard on 29.05.2007,
the Gauhati High Court, in the said writ petition, passed a detailed order. The
relevant portion of which reads as under:“(5) It appears that the aforesaid order dated 18.05.2007
was passed in furtherance of the orders dated 12.3.2007 and
30.4.2007 passed by this Court. It has been brought to the
notice of this Court that despite the order dated 18.5.2007, the
respondent No.10 & 11 have been carrying out their
programme and have been issuing advertisements and
encouraging students for admission which are in derogation
to the order passed on 18.5.2007 by the respondent No.9.
Some other activities have also been reported to have taken
place on the part of the respondent No.10 and 11 which may
also be treated to be in derogation and in defiance to the order
dated 18.5.2007. It has been submitted that the order dated
18.05.2007 is challenged by way of writ petition in Delhi
High Court, where no order has been passed as yet. In view
of the facts and circumstances, and taking into consideration
the clear and specific order dated 18.5.2007 having been
passed by the AICTE, the respondents No.9 herein, in
reference to the orders dated 12.3.2007 and 30.4.2007, it is
hereby directed that the respondent Nos 10 and 11 shall
abstain from carrying out any programme relating to the
aforesaid C.F.A. Course in India, and/or also restrained to
carry out any other activities whatsoever relatable to the
C.F.A. course.
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

(6)
The parties are at liberty to bring to the notice of this
Court about any defiance of the order dated 18.5.2007 for
seeking any direction by this Court. However, AICTE
Respondent No.9 is itself empowered for taking any action as
available under the Head of Punitive measures and conditions
for withdrawal as provided under All India Council for
Technical Education Notification dated 16th May, 2005
(Annexure P-11) to the supplementary affidavit. Henceforth,
the respondent Nos. 10 & 11 are hereby restrained not to
indulge in any such activities which may go or treated to be
contrary to the provisions of law. After passing order dated
18.5.2007 all admissions, registrations and other activities
including examination being conducted by respondent Nos.
10 & 11 shall have no value and force in the eyes of law.
(7)

Parties are at liberty to file additional affidavits also.

(8)
Liberty is given to the parties for seeking further
direction, clarification or modification from this court, if so
advised.
List this matter on 23.7.2007.”

20.

When the matter came up for further arguments before this Court on

29.05.2007, it was contended on behalf of the counsel for the respondent and
the ICFAI that the Gauhati High Court has already given its seal of approval to
the order dated 18.05.2007 and that, therefore, this court should hold its hand
and not pass any order which would be contrary to what the Gauhati High
Court has passed.

21.

It was contended on behalf of the petitioners that the order dated

18.05.2007

was passed in Delhi by the respondent / AICTE which is a

CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

statutory body located in Delhi and, therefore, any challenge to the same would
lie only before the Delhi High Court, both on account of the location of AICTE
against whom the writ is sought as well as on account of the cause of action
having arisen in Delhi. It was submitted that, therefore, the Delhi High Court
was the appropriate court having territorial jurisdiction insofar as the challenge
to the impugned order dated 18.05.2007 was concerned, in respect of both subArticles (1) and (2) of Article 226 of the Constitution of India. On behalf of the
respondents, it was contended that while this court admittedly has territorial
jurisdiction to entertain a petition challenging the order dated 18.05.2007
passed by the AICTE, the issue with regard to whether the petitioner No.1 fell
within the scope and ambit of the AICTE Act and the 2005 Regulations was
under consideration of the Gauhati High Court (Agartala Bench). Since that
writ petition was prior in time, this court ought not to pass any order which
would be in the teeth of the order passed by that High Court on 28.05.2007.

22.

The Supreme Court decision in the case of Narendra Kumar

Maheshwari v. Union of India and Others: 1990 (Suppl) SCC 440 was also
referred to by counsel on both sides with regard to the principle of comity of
courts in a federal structure. The passage which was referred to was contained
in paragraph 113 thereof which reads as under:“113. Before we conclude, we must note that good deal of
argument was adduced that these applications in different High
Courts in civil suits were not genuine and properly motivated,
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

but were mala fide. Even though these might not have been to
fee fat an innocent object, it was apparent that it was to feed fat
a grudge in respect of a competitive project by a competitor.
Anyway, in the view we have taken, it is not necessary to decide
the bona fides or mala fides of the applicants. Shri Nariman,
when he moved the application initially, had suggested that we
should lay down certain norms as to how the courts in different
parts of the country should grant injunction or entertain
applications affecting an all-India issue or having ramifications
all over the country. Except that before the courts grant any
injunction, they should have regard to the principles of comity
of courts in a federal structure and have regard to self-restraint
and circumspection, we do not at this stage lay down any more
definite norms. We may also perhaps add that it may be
impossible to lay down hard and fast rules of general application
because of the diverse situations which give rise to problems of
this nature.
Each case has its own special facts and
complications and it will be a disadvantage, rather than an
advantage, to attempt and apply any stereotyped formula to all
cases. Perhaps in this sphere, the High Courts themselves might
be able to introduce a certain amount of discipline having regard
to the principles of comity of courts administering the same
general laws applicable all over the country in respect of
granting interim orders which will have repercussion or effect
beyond the jurisdiction of the particular courts. Such an
exercise will be useful contribution in evolving good
conventions in the federal judicial system.”
23.

The above observations of the Supreme Court clearly indicate that they

refrained from laying down any definite norms apart from suggesting that
before courts grant any injunction, they should have regard to principles of
comity of courts in a federal structure and should have regard to self-restraint
and circumspection. However, they qualified this by saying that it would be
impossible to lay down hard and fast rules of general application because of the
diverse situations which give rise to problems of this nature. Each case has its

Page No.1 of 31

own special facts and complications and in this context, the Supreme Court
observed that “it will be a disadvantage rather than an advantage to attempt
and apply any stereotyped formula to all cases”. The Supreme Court left it to
the High Courts to introduce a certain amount of discipline having regard to the
principles of comity of courts administering the same general laws applicable
all over the country in respect of granting interim orders which may have
repercussions or effect beyond the jurisdiction of the particular courts.

There was some degree of debate amongst the counsel with regard to

territorial jurisdiction of the Gauhati High Court in passing the order dated
28.05.2007. According to the petitioners, the impugned order dated 18.05.2007
could only be challenged before the Delhi High Court and the Gauhati High
Court had no jurisdiction with regard to the same. On behalf of the petitioners,
the Supreme Court decision in Oil and Natural Gas Commission v. Utpal
Kumar Basu and Others: 1994 (4) SCC 711 was referred to in support of the
contention of that the High Court at Gauhati did not have territorial jurisdiction.
The petitioners also relied upon the decision in the case of Sushil Kumar
Mehta v. Gobind Ram Bhora (dead) Through his Lrs.: 1990 (1) SCC 193 to
contend that an order passed by a court without jurisdiction over the subject
matter would be coram non judice. The said decision referred to a decree being
passed by a court without jurisdiction. The Supreme Court observed that a
decree passed by such court would be a nullity and would be non est and that its
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

invalidity can be set up whenever it is sought to be enforced or it is acted upon
as a foundation for a right, even at the stage of execution or in collateral
proceedings. On behalf of the petitioners, the submission went on to the extent
of saying that the order dated 28.05.2007 was one such order and since it is
being set up as a foundation by the respondent, the same can certainly be
agitated before this court at this stage. A reference was also made to Board of
Trustees for the Port of Calcutta and Another v. Bombay Flour Mills Pvt. Ltd
and Another: AIR 1995 SC 577 (para 4) to indicate that an order without
jurisdiction would be a nullity.

25.

On behalf of the respondents, Mr Sharan submitted that the AICTE acted

on the interim directions given by the Gauhati High Court and passed the
impugned order dated 18.05.2007. The issue whether the petitioner fell within
the AICTE regime was a question before the Gauhati High Court. The same
issue is being raised here. He contended that the petitioner was a party to the
proceedings before the Gauhati High Court and acquiesced to its jurisdiction,
therefore, it cannot challenge the territorial jurisdiction of the Gauhati High
Court and that to before this court.

He submitted that the orders dated

12.03.2007, 30.04.2007 and 28.05.2007 passed by the Gauhati High Court were
after the counsel for the parties had been heard. Since the petitioners had failed
to get a favourable order, they have approached the Delhi High Court. In this

CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

context, he submitted that there was no infirmity with the Gauhati High Court
in passing the order dated 28.05.2007.

26.

Mr Parag Tripathi, who was permitted to make his submissions on

behalf of the ICFAI which has moved an application for intervention, only
made submissions with regard to the propriety of this court passing an order
which might contradict the order passed by the Gauhati High Court.

A

reference was made to the observations of Lord Diplock in the decision of the
case known as The “Abidin Daver”: 1984 Vol.1 Lloyd's Law Reports 339
(House of Lords) to the following effect:“Since the District Court of Sariyer would be recognized by
the English High Court as a Court of competent jurisdiction,
any judgment given by it against the Cuban owners would be
enforceable in England by action; so an unseemly race to be
the first to obtain judgment in the jurisdictions in which the
Turkish owners and the Cuban owners respectively are
plaintiffs might well ensue; and novel problems relating to
estoppel per rem judicatam and issue estoppel, which have not
hitherto been examined by any English Court, might also
arise. Comity demands that such a situation should not be
permitted to occur as between Courts of two civilized and
friendly states. It is a recipe for confusion and injustice.
27.

Essentially, what Mr Tripathi submitted is that the “unseemly race to be

the first to obtain judgment” should be avoided and that comity demanded that
such a situation should not be permitted to occur as between courts of two
different States under the federal structure. He also referred to a decision of the

CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

Supreme Court in the case of Om Prakash Srivastava v. Union of India and
Another: 2006 (6) SCC 207.

28.

Therefore, I am faced with this dilemma. On the other hand, the Delhi

High Court has territorial jurisdiction to entertain this writ petition which
challenges the impugned order dated 18.05.2007. It has jurisdiction to pass
orders in exercise of its powers under Article 226 of the Constitution in respect
of the said challenge. On the other hand, the Gauhati High Court has passed an
order dated 28.05.2007 which has seemingly granted its imprimatur to the
impugned order dated 18.05.2007. As regards the question of whether the
Gauhati High Court had territorial jurisdiction or not in passing the said order,
it would not be proper for this court to go into this question at all. The only
issue before this court is whether the present writ petition falls within the
territorial jurisdiction of this court.

High Courts can rule on their own

jurisdiction and it would not be proper for them to rule on the jurisdiction of
other High Courts. Insofar as the present subject matter is concerned, the
admitted position as well as the position in law is that this court has jurisdiction
to entertain the challenge against the order dated 18.05.2007 passed by the
AICTE.

29.

The only question is whether any order can be passed which is

contradictory to what the Gauhati High Court has directed by virtue of its order
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

dated 28.05.2007.

I would also like to refer to two decisions of the US

Supreme Court on the question of comity of courts. In Hartford Fire Ins. Co.
v. Cal., 509 U.S. 764, it was observed that the comity of courts refers to a
situation where judges decline to exercise jurisdiction over matters more
appropriately adjudged elsewhere. In Parsi v. Davidson: 405 U.S. 34, it was
observed that under accepted principles of comity, a court should stay its hand
only if the relief the petitioner seeks would also be available to him with
reasonable promptness and certainty through the alternative machinery. These
principles ought to be kept in mind and would apply with equal vigour in the
situation which has arisen in the present case. Can it be said that this court
should decline to exercise jurisdiction in respect of the subject matter of this
petition because it can be more appropriately be adjudged at Gauhati ? Two
circumstances come to mind. The first is that the petition filed before the
Gauhati High Court is not by the present petitioners. The petitioner No.1
herein is a respondent in that petition. And, the petitioner No.2 is not a party in
those proceedings. Secondly, the order dated 18.05.2007 is not the subject
matter of challenge before the Gauhati High Court.

The petitioners have

challenged that order before this court.

30.

In any event, the entire discussion with regard to comity is based on the

assumption that if an order permitting the holding of examinations on
03.06.2007 is passed by this court, it would be contradictory to the order dated
CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

28.05.2007 passed by the Gauhati High Court. If one carefully examines the
order passed by the Gauhati High Court, one would be impressed by the fact
that the order has been passed with due regard to the principle of comity of
courts. This is easily demonstrated by reference to the following passage
occurring in the said order:“It has been submitted that the order dated 18.05.2007 is
challenged by way of writ petition in Delhi High Court, where
no order has been passed as yet... In view of the facts and
circumstances,.......”
(underlining added)
The Gauhati High Court was mindful of the fact that this court was seized of
the writ petition which challenged the order dated 18.05.2007 and the directions
that it did issue by virtue of the order dated 28.05.2007 are to be circumscribed
by the words “no order has been passed as yet”. It is clear that if an order had
been passed, then, perhaps, the order dated 28.05.2007 may not have been
issued in the form it exists today. In any event, the directions given are based
on the order dated 18.05.2007 treating the same to be valid as the same was not
the subject matter of challenge before the court and the court has appropriately
directed compliance with the same. I would read the said order as being
operational till the impugned order dated 18.05.2007 remains unchallenged.

31.

This being the position, I see no reason to see any conflict over orders of

two High Courts or violation of the principles of comity if this court went

CM7602/2007 in WP(C) 4037/07

Page No.1 of 31

ahead and issued an order permitting the examination to take place on
03.06.2007.

32.

Accordingly, the operation of the impugned order dated 18.05.2007 is

stayed till the writ petition is disposed of to the extent that the petitioner No.1 is
permitted to go ahead with the examination in India on 03.06.2007.
A copy of this order be given dasti under the signature of the Court
Master.
