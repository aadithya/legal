This suit has been filed by the plaintiff seeking a decree of

specific performance of an agreement to sell and purchase dated 17th
March, 2000. Inasmuch as there is no dispute to the material facts
which are necessary for the purposes of adjudication of the claim of
the plaintiff, this court has heard the parties and has proceeded to
judgment under the provisions of Order 12 Rule 6 of the Code of Civil
Procedure (hereinafter referred to as 'CPC`). The parties have been
CS (OS) No.616/2002

Page No.1

heard on the respective claims and contentions and the record of this
case has been carefully perused. The admitted facts so far as they are
relevant for the purpose of deciding the present suit, are briefly noted
hereafter.
2.

The plaintiff entered into an agreement to sell and purchase

dated 17th March, 2000 with the defendant no.1 Shri Yashdeep Singh
Kataria whereby the plaintiff agreed to purchase the property owned
by the defendant no.1 bearing no. C-85, Sector - 41, Noida, District
Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P. at a total sale consideration of
Rs.25,00,000/-. The defendant no.1 had represented that he was the
sole and absolute owner in possession of the suit property and it was
his self acquired property.
3.

The plaintiff made a payment of Rs.7,00,000/- in cash to the

defendant no.1 at Delhi on 17th March, 2000 as advance part
payment of the sale consideration. The defendant no.1 acknowledged
receipt of this amount in the agreement dated 17th March, 2000.
4.

The defendant no.1 had taken a loan of Rs.8,00,000/- from

HUDCO, defendant no.2, towards purchase of this property and had
mortgaged the property to the defendant no.2 towards security for
the loan. The defendant no.2 has submitted before this court that
after registration of the property in favour of defendant no.1 by the

CS (OS) No.616/2002

Page No.2

superior owner, the defendant no.1 was required to deposit the sale
deed of the property to HUDCO. However, defendant no.1 failed to
collect the original title deeds from the Registrar of Assurances,
Noida. As on 31st October, 2005, the defendant no.2 was claiming a
sum of Rs.3,29,186/- as due and payable by the defendant no.1.
5.

Apart from the amount of Rs.7,00,000/- paid by the plaintiff to

the defendant no.1, the plaintiff paid a further amount to the
defendant under the terms of the agreement to sell. On the 28th
April, 2000, the plaintiff paid a further sum of Rs.16,00,000/bringing the total amount paid to the defendant to Rs.23,00,000/-.
The defendant no.1 has admittedly acknowledged and executed a
receipt

dated

28th

April,

2000

acknowledging

receipt

of

Rs.16,00,000/- and confirming receipt of the total amount of
Rs.23,00,000/- towards the agreed sale consideration. Thereby only
a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- remained due and payable towards the
balance sale consideration.
6.

The terms and conditions of agreement to sell postulated that

the final payment for the transaction was to be made on or before
17th June, 2000.

The defendant no.1 had also agreed to deliver

vacant peaceful physical possession of the suit property to the
plaintiff at the site along with the original documents relating to the

CS (OS) No.616/2002

Page No.3

property at the time of execution of the final sale deed or latest by the
date of final payment made by the plaintiff to the defendant no.1 on
or before the 17th June, 2000. The plaintiff has submitted that he
had repeatedly approached the defendant no.1 from time to time
requesting him to perform his part of the agreement and also for
obtaining necessary clearances from various authorities including the
income tax authority and for finalisation and execution of the
documents including the sale deed before the sub-registrar in respect
of the suit property in favour of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff has

submitted that the defendant no.1 started avoiding the plaintiff on
one pretext or another and would not complete the formalities
towards the sale of the property.
7.

The plaintiff has also urged that on 31st May, 2000, the Central

Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter referrred to as `CBI') seized
from the defendant no.1 the original agreement to sell and purchase
dated 17th March, 2000 as well as the original receipt confirming
payment of Rs.23,00,000/- by the plaintiff to the defendant no.1.
The plaintiff contacted the defendant no.1 on 15th June, 2000 and
called upon him to execute the necessary documents of transfer of the
suit property in favour of the plaintiff before the Sub-Registrar as also
to accept the balance sale consideration. The plaintiff was informed

CS (OS) No.616/2002

Page No.4

by the defendant no.1 that the original documents of the property
were lying with the Central Bureau of Investigation as a case stood
registered against him. The defendant no.1 requested for 45 days'
time to get the papers released from the CBI and to get the necessary
sale deed executed.
8.

Since the defendant no.1 did not take any steps to get the

documents released nor proceeded towards execution of the sale deed
in favour of the plaintiff, the plaintiff caused a legal notice dated 3rd
August, 2000 to be served upon the defendant no.1 requiring the
defendant no.1 to make all necessary arrangements for getting the
sale deed executed in favour of the plaintiff within three weeks of the
receipt of the notice.

In its reply dated 11th August, 2000, the

defendant no.1 again admitted all material facts including the
agreement between the parties as well as receipt of the sale
consideration. The defendant no.1, however, stated that he had been
implicated in a false case and that all papers with regard to the suit
property and the transaction between the parties, had been seized by
the Central Bureau of Investigation. The defendant no.1 again stated
that he was pursuing the CBI for the release of the documentation in
order to enable him to complete the sale transaction.
9.

The plaintiff was apprehensive that the intention of the

CS (OS) No.616/2002

Page No.5

defendant no.1 was mala fide and that the defendant no.1 intended to
misappropriate the hard earned money of the plaintiff.

An

enforceable and concluded contract having come into existence
between the parties in respect of the suit property, the plaintiff filed
the present suit seeking the following reliefs against the defendant
no.1 on the 17th June, 2001:1.

Pass a decree of specific performance in favour of
the plaintiff and against the defendant, whereby
directing the defendant to execute the proper
sale deed in favour of the plaintiff, in respect of
the property bearing no.C-85, Sector-41, NOIDA,
District Gautam Budh Nagar, U.P. for the
completion of agreement to sell dated 17th
March, 2000 after accepting the balance sale
consideration in the sum of Rs.2,00,000/(Rs.two lacs only) from the plaintiff; or
alternatively;

2. Allow the plaintiff to deposit in this Hon'ble
Court a sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (rupees two lacs
only) being the balance sale consideration as
settled under the agreement tyo sell dated 17th
March, 2000, and be further pleased to allow the
plaintiff to complete all necessary formalities, as
required for the registration of the sale deed etc.
in respect of the said property under sale, either
himself or through the Registrar or any other
officer of this Hon'ble Court; or alternatively;
3. Pass a decree for recovery of Rs.25,00,000/- in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant
and be further pleased to pass a decree in favour
of the plaintiff and against the defendant for
interest pendente lite as well as further interest
@ 18% per annum compound;

CS (OS) No.616/2002

Page No.6

4. Award cost of suit in favour of the plaintiff and
against the defendant; &

10.

5. Pass such other and further order or orders in
favour of the plaintiff and against the defendant
as this Hon'ble Court may deed for and proper in
the facts and circumstances of the present case.
The plaintiff has submitted in the plaint that he was all along

ready, willing and able to purchase the suit property from the
defendant no.1 and that it is the defendant no.1 who has failed to
receive the balance sale consideration of Rs.2,00,000/-and to execute
the document of title.
11.

The defendant no.1 in its written statement has set up a defence

which was similar to the stand taken in the reply dated 11th August,
2000 sent by him through counsel to the plaintiff. Inasmuch as there
was no dispute to the facts set up by the plaintiff, the plaintiff
immediately made a prayer for a decree under Order 12 Rule 6 of the
CPC against the defendant no.1.
12.

In the proceedings held by this court on 25th September, 2003,

upon a perusal of the documents on record, it was suggested that the
suit property is lying under mortgage of HUDCO on account of loan
taken by the defendant no.1. Consequently, the court was of the view
that interests of justice merited that a notice be issued to HUDCO to
appear before the court and disclose what amount is due to it from
the defendant no.1 and what were the terms and conditions of the
CS (OS) No.616/2002

Page No.7

mortgage. The court directed a notice to issue to HUDCO, returnable
on 16th December, 2003.
13.

On the same date, the court directed the Director, CBI for

producing the original agreement to sell which was lying with it in
case No.RC-DA1-2000-A-0023 dated 4th May, 2000 before this
court.
14.

Pursuant to the orders passed by this court, the original

agreement to sell dated 4th May, 2000 was filed in this court by
Mr. Anil Kumar, Inspector of the CBI on the 16th December, 2003.
HUDCO was also impleaded as defendant no.2 and had put in
appearance before this court on 5th August, 2005. The defendant
no.2-HUDCO had filed a written statement dated 26th October,
2005, submitting that as on 31st October, 2005, a sum of
Rs.3,29,186/- was due and payable by the defendant no.1 to it and
that without first clearing the entire dues of the defendant no.2, no
order in favour of the plaintiff should be passed.
On the 25th January, 2006, it was stated by the defendant no.1
that it had made payment of the entire dues of the defendant no.2.
Nothing to the contrary has been informed to this court. In this view
of the matter, the defendant no.2 having received payment of its
dues, has no right or claim in respect of the suit property or against

CS (OS) No.616/2002

Page No.8

the defendant no.1.
15.

The plaintiff has averred and shown that he was throughout

ready, willing and able to perform his part of the agreement. The
substantial part of the sale

consideration

to the tune of

Rs.23,00,000/- out of the total sale consideration of Rs.25,00,000/stands paid. The defendant no.1 has also admitted and accepted its
liability and its willingness to execute the sale deed against receipt of
the balance sale consideration. The original agreement to sell is also
lying in this court.
16.

No order of the court or legal provision prohibiting grant of the

decree for specific performance has been pointed out by any person
or authority on record.
I find that there is no dispute in the instant case with regard to
either the execution and bindingness of the agreement to sell by the
defendant no.1 or to the receipt of sum of Rs.23,00,000/- from the
plaintiff out of the total sale consideration of Rs.25,00,000/-. The
defendant no.1 has submitted that he is willing to execute the sale
even today and it is on account of unavoidable circumstances that
delay has occurred in the execution of the sale deed. The plaintiff has
also established on record his ready, willingness and ability to pay the
balance sale consideration on all material dates and times.

CS (OS) No.616/2002

Page No.9

The

admissions by the defendant no.1 are unequivocal & categorical.
There is, thus, no impediment to the court to grant to the
plaintiff relief of specific performance of the agreement dated 17th
March, 2000 under Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act which
requires discretion to be exercised in favour of the plaintiff on
equitable considerations.
Accordingly, I hereby grant a decree of specific performance to
the plaintiff of the agreement dated 17th March, 2000 in favour of the
plaintiff and against the defendant no.1 for specific performance of
the agreement dated 17th March, 2000 subject to the plaintiff making
payment of the balance sale consideration of Rs.2,00,000/- to the
defendant no.1 within a period of three months from today. The
defendant shall positively execute the sale deed of the property
bearing no.C-85, Sector - 41, Noida, district Gautam Budh Nagar,
U.P. in favour of the plaintiff within four weeks thereafter. In case
the defendant fails to execute the sale deed, the plaintiff shall be at
liberty to get the sale deed executed through this court by making an
application in respect thereto to this court.
The plaintiff shall be entitled to costs of the suit which are
quantified at Rs.55,000/-. The plaintiff shall be entitled to adjust the
amount of costs out of the balance sale consideration and therefore

CS (OS) No.616/2002

would be required to make payment of Rs.1,45,000/- only.
The plaintiff shall pay the amount payable to the defendant no.1
by means of a demand draft.
