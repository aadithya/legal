1.

By this writ petition, the petitioner assails an order

dated 6th November, 1998 passed by the Labour Court on an
application filed by the respondent/workman under Section 33 (C)
(ii) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.

It appears that the

respondent/workman was employed as a driver by the petitioner
between the period from 16th February, 1987 till 10th January, 1991
on a monthly salary of Rs. 1700/-.

After his services were

terminated, the workman filed a complaint to the Labour Court
:1:

WP(C) 1404/1999

Commissioner in respect of which the petitioner received a notice
dated 13th March, 2001. The workman had also filed a complaint
dated 23rd April, 1991 to the Conciliation Officer wherein the
workman had prayed for a direction to the petitioner to take him
back on service with all back wages and salary.
2.

According to the petitioner, in the proceedings which

were conducted before the Conciliation Officer, the parties entered
into a full and final settlement of all disputes which were reduced
to a Memorandum of Settlement dated 24th July, 1991 which has
been placed before this court as Annexure P-6. It is pointed out
that in terms of the settlement, the workman had agreed to receive
a total amount of Rs. 8500/-, which was to be paid to the workman
in four instalments which amount to Rs. 1000/-, Rs. 700/-, Rs.
5000/- and Rs. 1800/- on 24th July, 1991. The Memorandum of
Settlement which has been placed on record noticed that the
workman has received Rs. 8500/- in full and final settlement. The
petitioner has placed before this court a photocopy of the receipt
dated 24th July, 1991 which has been executed by the respondent
acknowledging receipt of the bank draft of Rs. 5000/-. According
to the petitioner, this amount was towards the settlement amount
and has been paid before the Labour Court/Conciliation Officer.
:2:

WP(C) 1404/1999

3.

Thereafter, it appears that the respondent has filed an

application under Section 33 (C) (ii) of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 dated 29th November, 1994 before the Labour Court stating
the workman has not received overtime allowance, bonus, leave
encashments etc. totaling Rs. 1,13,831.31/-. The Labour Court
itself noticed all these proceedings. The petitioner has contended
that no notice of the proceedings before the industrial adjudicator
was ever served upon it. However, based on a receipt on the
acknowledgment card, the petitioner was proceeded ex-parte by
an order dated 6th November, 1998. The workman had filed an
affidavit by way of evidence repeating the contents of his claim
where upon the ex-parte order dated 6th November, 1998 was
passed directing the petitioner to pay a sum of Rs. 1,13,831.31/- to
the workman.
4.

The petitioner has contended that it was unaware of the

entire proceedings conducted by the Labour Court and gained
knowledge of the pendency of the matter only when it received a
notice from the Implementation Section of the Labour Department
in order to implement the order dated 6th November, 1998.

5.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on
:3:

WP(C) 1404/1999

the pronouncement of this court reported at 71 (1998) DLT 1
(DB) entitled Satish Khosla Vs. M/s Eli Lilly Ranbaxy Ltd.
& Anr. as well as another pronouncement of this court reported
at

(1999)

DLT

207

entitled

Holy

Health

and

Educational Society (Regd.) Vs. Delhi Development
Authority to contend that the respondent is disentitled to any
relief on the ground of concealment of material facts.
6.

Learned counsel for the petitioner in this matter has also

vehemently urged that Section 18 (3) (a) of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 mandates that a settlement arrived at during the course
of conciliation is binding on the parties. My attention has also
been drawn to the provisions of Section 29 of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 dealing with breach of settlement.
7.

So far as bindingness of a settlement is concerned,

reliance has been placed on the pronouncements of the Apex Court
reported at AIR 2000 SC 469 entitled National Engineering
Industries Ltd. Vs. State of Rajasthan & Ors.; (1990) 3
SCR 282 entitled Barauni Refinery Pragatisheel Shramik
Parishad & Ors. Vs. Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors. as
well as pronouncement of this court reported at 49 (1993) DLT
329 entitled Blue Star Ltd. Vs. K.S. Khurana & Ors.

WP(C) 1404/1999

8.

Learned counsel for the respondent has vehemently

opposed the writ petition and contended that the stand of the
petitioner to the effect that any amount was paid to the workman
before any Labour Court is wholly false and incorrect. It is further
contended that the workman has not entered into any settlement
and has not received any amount from the management. It is
further contended that the respondent deliberately opted not to
appear before the Labour Court in answer to the notice which was
issued to the petitioner from the Implementation Section of the
Labour Department.
9.

I have heard learned counsel for both the parties. I find

that so far as service of the notice is concerned, perusal of the
record of the Labour Court would show that there is some kind of
acknowledgment card which has been received back by the Labour
Court. From a comparison of the signatures of the petitioner as are
available before this court in several affidavits with the incomplete
scribble on the Acknowledgment Card, it is evident, even to the
naked eye that the signatures do not match. The petitioner writes
an initial superimposed by the first letter of his last name and puts
his full surname in his signatures.

The signatures on the

acknowledgment card is crude attempt of copying the petitioner's
:5:

WP(C) 1404/1999

signatures and does not appear to be at all similar. I therefore,
find force in the submission of the petitioner that it was never
served with the notice from the Labour Court.
10.

Even if this issue was to be held against the petitioner so

far as issue whether the petitioner was served with notice or not, I
find that the petitioner deserves to succeed on yet another ground.
Perusal of the complaint dated 3rd April, 1991 filed by the workman
shows that the workman claimed that he had spent Rs. 3000/- on
repairs of the proprietor's Car No. DDA 5348 from his own bonus
and that the petitioner had not effected payment of this amount.
It was specifically stated by the workman that the petitioner had
made payment of the salary which was payable to the workman for
the month of December, 1990 on the 1st January, 1991 but had not
paid salary for the period 1st January, 1991 to 9th January, 1991.
Therefore, herein is an admission that that the workman had
received an amount towards his salary.
In the claim dated 29th November, 1994 which was filed
by the workman under Section 33 (C) (ii) of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947 before the Labour Court, the workman made a
claim for wages for the period 1st January, 1991 to 10th January,
1991; bonus for three years; leave encashment for 59 days per
:6:

WP(C) 1404/1999

year; overtime for four hours per day for the period from 16th
February, 1987 to 10th January, 1991 and also complained against
non-grant of leave on national holidays of 275 days.
11.

The respondent/workman filed an application before

this court bearing CM No. 6184/1999 wherein it is pointed out that
the workman does not give any particulars or details of the amount
which had been actually received by him.
12.

However, in the rejoinder dated 11th January, 2000 filed

by the respondent in CM No. 6184/1999, in para 2, the workman
has stated that he had got Rs. 8500/- towards his claim of salary
due with bonus, overtime etc. before raising the dispute before the
Labour Commissioner/Conciliation Officer. Whereas in para 3 of
the rejoinder, the respondent went on to expand the same by
stating that he had got Rs. 8500/- out of the claimed amount of
Rs. 1,31,831.31paise. This averment is repeated in later paras of the
reply/rejoinder wherein the receipt of Rs. 5000/- by way of
demand draft is admitted.

However, the case set up by the

respondent herein is that the amount which had been received by
him is not on account of settlement but out of the claimed amount
of Rs. 1,31,831.31paise.
13.

The petitioner has contended that it has made payments
:7:

WP(C) 1404/1999

to the respondent/workman.

These include payment of Rs.

1000/-, Rs. 700/-, Rs. 5000/- and Rs. 1800/- in four different
instalments to the workman and it has further been contended
that this amount was paid towards the settlement arrived at
between the parties. The workman began by denying receipt of
any payment from the petitioner. In subsequent pleadings the
workman has admitted that he had received Rs. 1700/- as salary
and also receipt of Rs. 5000/- by way of the bank draft out of the
amount which has been claimed by him.
14.

Matters do not end here. An affidavit has been again

filed by the workman on 17th May, 2003 wherein the workman
stated that in the year 1990, an accident had occurred when the
parties were coming from Hathras to Delhi and the respondent
had got instructions for the repair works of the vehicle i.e.
proprietor's Car No. DDA 5348. It has been stated that on the
repair work of the vehicle, the respondent had incurred expenses
of Rs. 8500/- which includes the salary of Rs. 1700/- for the
month of December, 1990. The workman has stated that he has
received payment of only Rs. 6800/- out of this amount and that
the balance amount of salary of Rs. 1700/- has not been paid to the
workman till date.

It has been stated herein that he has not
:8:

WP(C) 1404/1999

included the salary amount of Rs. 1700/- in his claimed amount of
Rs. 1,31,831.31paise.
In this affidavit, the workman has also stated that he has
received Rs. 6800/- at the residence of the petitioner.
It is noteworthy that even in this affidavit, the workman
has gone ahead to state in para 5 that the statement made by him
is “true and correct to the best of his knowledge.”
15.

From the perusal of the record, it is evident that the

workman has taken different stands at different place. Beginning
by a complete denial, he has admitted receipt of Rs. 5000/- by
way of bank draft in one place and Rs. 6800/- in another place.
These payments have admittedly been received before the
workman filing its claim application on 29th November, 1994
under Section 33 (C) (ii) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Yet,
as is apparent from a perusal of the application that the workman
has not disclosed receipt of these payments in it.
16.

In the case of Satish Khosla Vs. M/s Eli Lilly

Ranbaxy Ltd. & Anr., 71 (1998) DLT 1 (DB), this court was
called upon to consider the matter where the plaintiff did not
disclose that in an earlier suit, the respondent had claimed a
similar relief which had not been granted. It was held by the
:9:

WP(C) 1404/1999

Division Bench that by withholding the plaint and the application
in the earlier suit from the court and by not disclosing to the court
about the proceedings in the earlier suit and the stay having not
been granted, the respondent/plaintiff had tried to get an
advantage from the court. In these circumstances, it was held that
the plaintiff had played fraud on the court as well as on the
opposite party and that the suit filed by the plaintiff was liable to
be dismissed in view of suppression and concealment of material
facts and his failure to come to the court with clean hands.
Warning was issued to the plaintiff in this behalf. Placing reliance
on the pronouncements of the Apex Court reported at AIR 1977
SC 2421 entitled T.Arivandandam Vs. T.V. Satyapal &
Anr. and in AIR 1994 SC 853 entitled S.P. Chengalvaraya
Naidu Vs. Jagannath & Ors., it was held that courts of law are
meant for imparting justice between the parties and that one who
comes to the court, must come with clean hands. It was stated that
a person whose case is based on falsehood has no right to
approach the Court and can be thrown out at any stage of the
litigation.
17.

In the case of Holy Health and Educational

Society (Regd.) Vs. Delhi Development Authority,
: 10 :

WP(C) 1404/1999

80

(1999) DLT 207, placing reliance on the pronouncement of this
court in Satish Khosla Vs. M/s Eli Lilly Ranbaxy Ltd. &
Anr. (supra) as well as on the pronouncement of the apex court
reported at AIR 1994 SC 853 entitled S.P. Chengalvaraya
Naidu Vs. Jagannath & Ors., it was held that the plaintiff had
failed to disclose the proceedings in the earlier suit and thus, he
was not granted stay thereon.
18.

In 2003 I AD (DELHI) 369 entitled Kesho Lal

Kapoor & Ors. Vs. Sh. Vinod Kapur & Anr., it was held that
concealment of the fact by both the parties has a significant effect
over the validity of the preliminary decree as well as its
executability.

Any decree obtained either through fraud or by

concealment

of

such

material

fact

which

if

taken

into

consideration would negate the decree itself cannot be deemed as
final or unquestionable. Nobody can be allowed to usurp the right
of other legal heirs that too in the property by not coming with
clean hands in the court. In view of this finding, the application of
the defendant for impleadment of party was allowed.
19.

In the instant case, the workman made a claim to the

Conciliation Officer on the 23rd April, 1991. He filed an application
on 29th November, 1994 under Section 33 (C) (ii) of the Industrial
: 11 :

WP(C) 1404/1999

Disputes Act, 1947 claiming an amount of Rs. 1,31,831.31paise
from the petitioner. He claimed that no amount had been received
by him after he left from his services.

Before this court, the

respondent has, however, taken different stands at different places
which have been noticed herein above. However, in each of these
stands, he has admitted that the amounts received by him were
towards the amount which was claimed by him before the Labour
Court.

Therefore, the respondent had actually concealed

payments which were actually received by him and the claim of the
respondent before the Labour Court under Section 33 (C) (ii) of
the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 was incorrect and admittedly
exaggerated. The respondent was thereby undoubtedly guilty of
concealment of material facts. In the light of the law laid down by
the

apex

court

in

AIR

1994

SC

853

entitled

S.P.

Chengalvaraya Naidu Vs. Jagannath & Ors. and in AIR
1977 SC 2421 entitled T.Arivandandam Vs. T.V. Satyapal
& Anr. as well as by this court reported at 71 (1998) DLT 1
(DB) entitled Satish Khosla Vs. M/s Eli Lilly Ranbaxy Ltd.
& Anr.; 80 (1999) DLT 207 entitled Holy Health and
Educational Society (Regd.) Vs. Delhi Development
Authority; and 2003 I AD (DELHI) 369 entitled Kesho Lal
: 12 :

WP(C) 1404/1999

Kapoor & Ors. Vs. Sh. Vinod Kapur & Anr., the respondent
has tried to get unfair advantage from this court and by
misrepresentation and concealment, is therefore guilty of playing
fraud upon this court as well as on the other side.
20.

Normally, the consequence of the setting aside of an ex-

parte award would be remand of the matter to the industrial
adjudicator who would thereupon be required to adjudicate upon
the same in accordance with law. In the instant case, I have found
that the claim filed by the workman was fraudulent and the
workman had actually claimed the amounts which he had
admitted having received in different places before this court.
Consequently, there would be no question of remand of such a
claim for adjudication and the claims have to be disrejected and
dismissed as such claims are fraudulent and have been raised by
concealment of material facts.
21.

So far as the genuineness and bona fide of the claim set

up by the petitioner is concerned, based on the admissions of the
workman, it has been held that the same is fraudulent and mala
fide.

The workman though has admitted receipt of different

amounts on different dates, however, he has completely
repudiated the settlement on which the petitioner has placed
: 13 :

WP(C) 1404/1999

reliance.

The workman has also denied signatures on the

photocopies of the settlement and the several receipts which have
been filed before this court.
Therefore, it is not permissible for this court to arrive at
any conclusion with regard to the plea of the petitioner that the
workman had entered into a full and final settlement and that the
amounts were received by him in terms of the settlement. This
question is consequently left open.
22.

In this view of the matter, the order dated 6th November,

1998 is held to be without jurisdiction inasmuch as the respondent
has been awarded amounts which actually stood received by him
and consequently, the same cannot stand.
Accordingly, this writ petition is allowed.
The order dated 6th November, 1998 is hereby set aside
and quashed and the application of the respondent dated 29th
November, 1994 is hereby dismissed.
This writ petition is allowed in the above terms with the
cost of Rs. 5,000/-.
