ARUNA SURESH, J.
1. Plaintiff company Swatch Limited, registered under the
laws of Switzerland, has filed the present suit for recovery
of money amounting to CHF 97,554.18 (Rs. 3,511,950.48/-)
against the defendant.

2. Undisputed facts as pleaded in the plaint are that the
plaintiff company entered into a distribution agreement
CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 1 of 15

with the defendant for watches manufactured by the
plaintiff in the territory of North and East India for a term
of 3 years from March 1, 2000 to February 28, 2003.
Subsequent to February

28,

2003,

plaintiff

supplied

watches to the defendant amounting to CHF 47,554.18
(approximately Rs. 17,11,950.48/-) during the month of
July, 2003 and raised seven invoices dated 10.7.2003,
21.7.2003, 21.7.2003, 28.7.2003, 28.7.2003, 30.7.2003,
30.7.2003 for the said amount.

Besides plaintiff has also

claimed imprest amount from the defendant amounting to
CHF 50,000 and accordingly raised a demand on the
defendant for the payment of the said amounts totaling to
CHF 97,554.18 vide letter dated 12.4.2006 within 21 days.

3. In para 14 of the plaint, it is averred by the plaintiff that as
per article 17 of the of the distribution agreement any
dispute arising out of it between the parties is to be
governed by and interpreted and construed in accordance
with Swiss laws and law of limitation under the Swiss Law
is 10 years as per general rule set out in Article 127 of the
Swiss Code of Obligations. Therefore, plaintiff has claimed
that the suit is within the period of limitation. Plaintiff has
claimed that Courts at Delhi has the jurisdiction to
entertain the present suit as defendant has its registered

CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 2 of 15

office in Delhi. The cause of action has arisen in Delhi as
the goods were supplied by the plaintiff at Delhi and the
business of the defendant is conducted from Delhi.

4. Since prima facie from the averments contained in the
plaint, the suit of the plaintiff was found to be barred by
period of limitation as it was filed approximately a year
after the expiry of period of limitation, the matter was
placed before the Court for directions regarding the issue
of limitation, vide order of the Joint Registrar dated
23.8.2007.

I have heard learned counsel for the plaintiff

at length and have gone through the pleadings contained in
the plaint as well as documents placed on record.

5. Article 17 of the Distribution Agreement dated 1.3.2000
inter se the parties is relevant for the purposes of present
issue under consideration.

Hence, it is reproduced as

follows:

“This agreement shall be governed
by, and interpreted and construed in
accordance with Swiss Law. The parties
herewith
expressly
exclude
the
applicability of the United Nations
Convention
on
Contracts
for
the
International Sale of Goods of April 11,
1980.
Any and all disputes arising in
connection with this agreement shall be
CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 3 of 15

submitted solely to the competent courts
of Canton of Bern/Switzerland.”
6. Reading of this article makes it clear that the parties to the
agreement are governed by the Swiss laws and the
agreement

has

to

be

interpreted

and

accordance with the laws of Switzerland.

construed

in

In case of

dispute having arisen in connection with this agreement,
the parties agreed to submit solely to the competent courts
of the Canton of Bern/Switzerland.

In other words, the

parties agreed that the Swiss courts shall have the
jurisdiction to entertain a dispute arising out of the
contract and the parties shall be governed by the Swiss
laws.

These laws clearly exclude the jurisdiction of the

Indian Courts to entertain any dispute or claim arising out
of this agreement and also application of Indian laws to
such disputes. The fact remains the plaintiff chose to file
the present suit in India and not in Switzerland.

This

agreement came to an end on 28.2.2003. Therefore, after
the termination of the agreement by afflux of time, it takes
out the defendant from the purview of application of Article
17. Therefore, claim of the plaintiff for imprest amount of
CHF 50,000 under the agreement dated 1.3.2000 which
came to an end on 28.2.2003 is barred by period of
limitation by application of Indian laws.

CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 4 of 15

7. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has submitted that though
this agreement came to an end on 28.2.2003 still claims in
the present suit and the disputes arisen between the
parties would continue to be governed by Article 17 of the
Distribution Agreement.

I do not find any force in these

submissions. After this agreement came to an end, it was
never

renewed

between

the

parties

nor

any

fresh

agreement was executed. As per the documents placed on
the record, plaintiff did supply watches vide seven invoices
of different dates for the period from 10.7.2003 to
30.7.2003. Letter dated 11.7.2003 is addressed to the
defendant by the plaintiff.

Perusal of this letter clearly

indicates that the goods supplied by the plaintiff company
to the defendant through said seven invoices did not
constitute an agency relationship between the parties nor a
distribution

agreement

express or implied.

or

like

arrangement

whether

It was also made clear that the

defendant shall not be entitled to hold itself out as an
agent, or a representative or distributor or official dealer
or the like of Swatch Ltd.

Same are the contents

contained in the letter dated 18.7.2003, 25.7.2003 and
31.7.2003.

Thus, it is clear that after 28.2.2003 the

Distribution Agreement came to an end automatically and
therefore, it cannot be said that Article 17 of the
CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 5 of 15

agreement continued to be applied to the transaction
which took place inter se the parties after 28.2.2003.
Hence except the claim of the plaintiff for the imprest
amount which was given to the defendant in terms of the
said agreement no other claim of the plaintiff falls within
the purview of Article 17 of the Agreement.

8. Now it is to be seen if once this agreement has come to an
end, whether parties to the suit continued to be governed
under the Swiss laws and the disputes arising out of
transactions can only be referred to and claimed by way of
a suit in a Swiss Court. It is admitted proposition of law
that where more than one courts have jurisdiction, parties
by consent can confer jurisdiction on one of the courts. But
where a court lacks inherent jurisdiction to entertain a suit,
parties by consent cannot confer jurisdiction in that court.

9. Para 2 of the letter dated 11.7.2003 speaks of application
of internal laws of Switzerland and para 3 speaks of
jurisdiction of Swiss Court in case of

disputes and

controversies arisen between the parties out of the supply
of goods by the plaintiff to the defendant.

These relevant

portions of the letter read as follows:

CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 6 of 15

“The legal effect of all dealings
between the parties is to be interpreted
according to the internal laws of
Switzerland.
Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the parties
expressly exclude the applicability of the
United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods of
April, 11, 1980.
All disputes and controversies
arising between the parties are to be
submitted for determination exclusively
to the Courts of the Canton of Bern in
Switzerland.
Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Swatch LTD. may at its option
seek interim and permanent injunctive
relief before any Court or like judicial
instance, which in the absence of the
foregoing
provision,
would
have
jurisdiction to grant the relief sought.”
10. Though the plaintiff reserved its rights to invoke
jurisdiction of the Swiss Court and the application of Swiss
laws but also kept an option with it to seek interim and
permanent injunctive relief before any court which in the
absence of the provisions contained in above would have
jurisdiction to grant the relief. In all the other letters dated
18.7.2003, 25.7.2003 and 31.7.2003 these two paragraphs
have been repeated in verbatim.

11.

Learned counsel for the plaintiff tried to state that in

view of the last three lines of the letters, plaintiff has the
option to invoke the jurisdiction of Delhi Court and also has
right to waive its right to file the suit in Swiss Court.
These submissions are devoid of merits.
CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Right of the
Page 7 of 15

plaintiff is restricted to seek an interim and permanent
injunctive relief before any Court. The present suit is not
for seeking an interim or permanent injunctive relief but is
simple suit for recovery of money. Therefore, the present
suit does not fall in the last three lines of the letter dated
11.7.2003 and other letters (dated 18.7.2003, 25.7.2003
and 31.7.2003) and therefore, plaintiff cannot be allowed
to interpret letter written by itself to its own advantage.

I

do not find any communication on behalf of the defendant
controverting the contents of the said letters nor any
objection to the invocation of jurisdiction of the Swiss
Court and the Swiss law.

12.Matter does not end here.

Plaintiff served legal notices

for demand upon the defendant. These notices are dated
12.4.2006, 26.10.2006 and 17.11.2006 and a notice issued
by Solicitors & Advocates at Delhi dated 25.7.2006.

13.In the letter dated 26.10.2006 it is made clear in the
following words:

“Please be advised that
unless
the
amount
of
CHF
97,554.18 representing your debt
towards Swatch Ltd. (excluding
interest) is received by Swatch Ltd.
on its bank account as earlier
CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 8 of 15

advised within 1 days from this
letter, a claim for payment of this
outstanding amount will be filed
against you in the courts of the
Canton of Berne, Switzerland, such
jurisdiction having been agreed by
you.”

14. While referring to the letter dated 26.10.2006, in the
letter

dated

17.11.2006

the

plaintiff

informed

the

defendant that since no payment had been received from it,
Swatch Limited would file a claim for payment of the
outstanding amounts against it in Switzerland.

Thus, it is

clear that at no point of time plaintiff agreed to file a suit to
claim its money from the defendant within the jurisdiction
of this Court.

15.Learned counsel for the plaintiff has alleged that he had a
right to waive the jurisdiction of Swiss Court and has the
right to file the present suit in Delhi.

He has referred to

Rhodia Ltd. and others v. Neon Laboratories Ltd. AIR 2002 Bombay 502. In the said case, an agreement
was entered into between English Company incorporated
under the English Law and an Indian company wherein it
was agreed to give exclusive right to the Indian company to
market

and

distribute

the

pharmaceutical

products

manufactured in India by the English company in the

CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 9 of 15

territories of India. The agreement further provided that
the governing language of the subject agreements shall be
English including formation thereof and performance
thereunder be governed by and construed in accordance
with English law.

The parties, therefore, expressly

intended the contract to be governed by and construed in
all

respects,

including

the

formation

thereof

and

performance thereunder in accordance with the English
law.

It was held that under those circumstances English

law will be proper law of the subject agreements.

The

'proper law' refers to the substantive principles of the
domestic law of the chosen system and not to its conflict of
laws rules.

The only limitation over this rule is that the

intention of the parties must be expressed bona fide and it
must not be opposed to public policy.

Considering the

transaction between the parties which was a contract in
international trade and commerce and the parties having
agreed expressly to submit to the jurisdiction of English
courts and English laws, it was held that the dispute has to
be settled by the English courts. It was further observed
that as per the settled principles of law a foreign law ought
to be pleaded like any other fact and must be proved by
evidence of experts in that law being matters of evidence
requiring proof as questions of fact, if a party wants to rely
CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 10 of 15

on the same.

Halsbury's Laws of India, 10 th Edition was

also referred to which is reproduced as below:

“75.237. Need for proof;
Foreign law is a question of fact.
It must be specifically pleaded by
the party or parties relying upon it.
It must be proved to the
satisfaction of the court like other
plea set up by the concerned party
or parties. Thus, the onus of proof
of foreign law lies on the party
relying on it.
75.238. Mode of proof: In
general, an Indian Court will not
research into foreign law or the
concepts which have foreign
origin.
The foreign law or the
concepts must be proved in civil
proceedings by properly qualified
witneses, that is a person who is
suitably qualified to do so on
account of his knowledge or
experience and who is competent
to give expert evidence as to the
alw of any country, irrespective of
whether he has acted or is entitled
to act as a legal practitioner there.
If his evidence is not contradicted,
the Court will normally accept it,
unless it is obviously unreliable or
extravagant. Where the witnesses
deposit materials as part of their
evidence into Court, the Court is
entitled
to
examine
those
materials, and where there is
conflict of evidence as to the
interpretation to be placed upon
the materials, the Court must
scrutinise them and form its own
conclusion on them.
Because foreign law or
concepts of a foreign origin are
questions of fact, courts may not
generally at common law rely upon
CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 11 of 15

a previous Indian
foreign law.”

decision

on

16.Coming back to the facts and circumstances of this case,
despite repeated questioning the plaintiff has not pleaded
Swiss laws which it seeks to invoke like any other fact
which it is required to prove in evidence. Learned counsel
for the plaintiff has argued that in para 14 of the plaint, he
has pleaded the Swiss law governing the period of
limitation for filing a claim of the nature like before me.
However, it cannot be disputed that he has not pleaded the
Swiss laws which will govern the case if the Swiss laws are
to be applied to the dispute inter se the parties.

17.In National

Thermal Power Corporation v. The

Singer Company and others – AIR 1993 SC 998 where
a similar issue was raised, it was observed that if the
intention of the parties is expressly stated in the contract
or it can be clearly inferred from the agreement itself or
the surrounding circumstances, such intention determines
the proper law of the contract. But where the intention of
the parties is not stated and no inference can be drawn,
their intention has no relevance and in that event, the
Courts

endeavour

should

be

to

infer

intention

by

identifying the legal system with which the transaction had
its closest and most real connection. It was also observed
CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 12 of 15

that expressed intention of the parties is generally decisive
in determining the proper law of the contract subject to the
condition that the intention of the parties must be
expressed bona fide and it should not be opposed to public
policy.

In that case, in view of the contract inter se the

parties it was held that there was no need to draw
inference about the intention of the parties or to impute
any

intention

to

them,

for

they

have

clearly

and

categorically stipulated that their contract made in India to
be performed in India is to be governed by the laws in
force in India and the Courts in Delhi have all jurisdiction
to entertain the matter under the contract.

18.In the present case, the parties had expressly and clearly
entered into an agreement to the effect that the dispute
arising out of the contract will be governed by Swiss laws
and the Courts at Switzerland shall have the exclusive
jurisdiction in all the matters arising out of the contract.

19.As to waiver of the objection to the territorial jurisdiction
of a Court, learned counsel for the plaintiff has referred to

Bahrein Petroleum Co. Ltd. v. P.J. Pappu and another
– AIR 1966 SC 634 .

CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 13 of 15

20.As per Civil Procedure Code, section 20-21 of the CPC,
defendant can raise objection to the territorial jurisdiction
of the Court and he can waive such objection agreeing to
come to the jurisdiction of the Court in which the suit has
been filed against him. This plea of waiver is not available
to the plaintiff. Therefore, Bahrein Petroleum Co. Ltd.

(supra) is of no help to the plaintiff. Plaintiff cannot be
allowed to arbitrarily choose its own jurisdiction to file its
suit.

21.In

British

India

Steam

Navigation

Co.

Ltd.

v.

Shanmughavila Cashew Industries – (1990) 3 SCC
481, it was observed that the jurisdiction of a Court can be
decided upon by the parties themselves on basis of various
connecting

factors.

The

parties

to

a

contract

in

international trade or commerce can agree in advance to a
forum which is to have jurisdiction to determine disputes
which may arise between them. The express choice of law
made by parties obviates need for interpretation.

This

chosen court may be a court in the country of one or both
the parties, or it may be a neutral forum. It is a question of
interpretation, governed by the proper law of the contract,
whether a jurisdiction clause is exclusive or non-exclusive,
or whether the claim which is the subject matter of the
CS (OS) No. 1542/2007

Page 14 of 15

action falls within its terms.

It is only in case when no

express choice of the proper law is made that the law of
the country of the chosen court will usually but not
invariably, be the proper law.

Principle of law as laid

down in this judgment is not disputed rather it goes against
the plaintiff as the parties to the contract expressly chose
the forum of jurisdiction to be that of the Swiss court.

22.In view of the discussion as above, it is concluded that this
court has no jurisdiction to entertain the present suit in
terms of the express agreement and intention of the parties
to invoke the jurisdiction of a Swiss Court in case a dispute
arose inter se them.

In view of this, I need not to go into

the question of limitation as pleaded as Swiss laws cannot
be made applicable to the present dispute raised in the
present case especially when the Swiss laws are not
specifically pleaded and also for the simple reason that I
find that this Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the
present suit as discussed above.

23. Hence, plaint is hereby rejected.
