ANIL KUMAR, J.
1.

The petitioner in this writ petition under Article 226 of the

Constitution of India has prayed for consideration of his seniority from
November, 1990 and has also claimed his salary and other benefits
since then.

2.

According to the petitioner out of 10 posts of Assistant

Superintendent in Central Jail, 3 were reserved for ex-servicemen. The
name of the petitioner was forwarded by the employment exchange
WP (C) 2128 of 1997

Page 1 of 11

and the petitioner was interviewed by the selection board on 21st
November, 1990.The petitioner contended that he is an ex-serviceman
released from Indian Army at the rank of hawaldar on medical
grounds after completing 21 years of service and his medical disability
was attributed and aggravated on account of military service.

3.

The grievance of the petitioner is that despite the fact that the

petitioner was in priority-I grade and his name was duly forwarded by
the employment exchange, the selection board in violation of rules and
regulations failed to consider the candidature of the petitioner. On the
representations being made by the petitioner a letter dated 4th
November, 1991 was issued by the Ministry of Defence to the
Inspector General of Prison to consider the application of the
petitioner for the said post as the petitioner was placed in the priorityI grade. According to the petitioner by letter dated 26th November,
1991 the respondent No.1 admitted their mistake and adviced the
petitioner that he should approach the Directorate General of
Rehabilitation and as and when the list of candidates for the said post
shall be called for, he will be considered.

Later on the petitioner was given an appointment in the year

1992 and consequently the petitioner raised his grievance relying on
the decisions of the Government of India bearing No.3/23/71/Estt.(D)
dated 24.12.1971 and No.14024/6/77/Estt.(D) dated 31.12.1979 &
13/34/71/Estt.(E) dated 1.2.1972 and contended that he should have
been selected in 1990 as he was a priority-I candidate and
consequently he should be given seniority since 1991 and also the
arrears of salary and other benefits.

5.

Though the petitioner made a grievance first time in July, 1992,

however, writ petition was not filed in 1992 or immediately thereafter.
The

petitioner

made

representation

and

continued

to

make

representations regarding grant of his seniority since 1990 when the
first DPC was held for appointment of Assistant Superintendents of
the Central Jail, Tihar, New Delhi. The petitioner ultimately filed the
present petition on 7th May, 1997 after about seven years when he
was not selected for the post by the DPC in 1990.

6.

The petition is contested by the respondents contending that the

writ petition is not maintainable as the petitioner has an alternate
remedy available to him under Section 14 of the Administrative
WP (C) 2128 of 1997

Page 3 of 11

Tribunals Act, 1985 and the High Court does not have jurisdiction to
entertain the petition claiming service benefits. The dismissal of the
writ

petition is also prayed on the ground that the petitioner is

claiming seniority from 1990 and the writ petition was filed after a
delay of 7 years without any cogent explanation. The relief to the
petitioner is contested also on the ground that he has not challenged
the decision of the Staff Selection Board constituted in the year 1990
by which all the appointments were made in the year 1990.

7.

The respondents have relied on (2002) 4 SCC 145, Kendriya

Vidalyaya Sangathan Vs. Subhash Sharma; (2004) 2 SCC 274,
Samarndra Das, Advocate Vs. State of West Bengal to contend that
the Central Administrative Tribunals has exclusive jurisdiction as
Court of first instance in relation to service matters and, therefore, the
High Court though has the power, however, it should not entertain a
writ petition directly.

8.

The petitioner who appears in person contends that the High

Court has the power and since the writ petition is pending since 1997
and he is seeking remedy since 1992 even though he was appointed
but he has not been given seniority since 1990 and he is on the verge
WP (C) 2128 of 1997

Page 4 of 11

of his retirement, therefore, it will be just and appropriate to entertain
the petition and decide the same as the Court has jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. The petitioner has relied on
(2003) 6 SCC 581, T.K. Rangarajan vs. Government of Tamil Nadu and
others; (2004) 7 SCC 166, S.J.S. Business Enterprises (P) Ltd. Vs.
State of Bihar and Others and (2004) 1 SCC 605, Radha Raman
Samanta Vs Bank of India & ors.

9.

In T.K. Rangarajan (supra) relied on by the petitioner it was

held that under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the High court
is empowered to exercise its extraordinary jurisdiction to meet
unprecedented extraordinary situations having no parallel remedy
though such extraordinary powers are to be used sparingly.

In that

case, the State Government had dismissed about two lakh employees
for going on strike and the Administrative Tribunal was manned only
by one person. In the circumstances, it was held by the Supreme
Court that the judgment of the larger Bench in L. Chandra Kumar
case, (1997) 3 SCC 271 was binding, however, if thousands of
employees are directed to approach the Administrative Tribunal, the
Tribunal would not be in a position to render justice to the cause and
consequently, it was held that because of “very very exceptional
circumstances” there is sufficient and justifiable reason for the High
WP (C) 2128 of 1997

Page 5 of 11

Court to entertain the petition despite an alternative remedy provided
under the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985. In S.J.S. Business
Enterprises (P) Ltd. (supra) relied on by the petitioner it was held that
existence of alternative remedy does not impinge on the jurisdiction of
the High court to hear the matter, if it is otherwise possible. In this
case the Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of
India was dismissed by the Single bench of the High Court on the
ground of suppression of the fact of the pendency of another suit
which was filed by the said petitioner prior to the institution of the
Writ petition. The appeal against the order of the single bench was
also dismissed by the division bench on the ground of suppression of
material fact. Thereafter SLP was filed and the Supreme Court had set
aside the order of the High Court and had observed that the filing of
the suit was not such a fact, the suppression of which could have
affected the disposal of the writ petition on merits. The Apex Court
had further held that where a party has initiated an alternative
remedy but not pursued it, the High Court can call upon the party to
elect either the alternative remedy or the writ petition and,
consequently, if the party has withdrawn the alternative remedy, by
the time the writ petition was heard, the writ petition should not be
rejected on the ground that the party had not disclosed the pendency
of alternative remedy already taken by such a party. The petitioner
has also relied on (2004) 1 SCC 605, Radha Raman Samanta Vs Bank
WP (C) 2128 of 1997

Page 6 of 11

of India & ors where the Apex Court had held that the claim of
alternative remedy not having been raised before the single judge,
could not be raised before the Division Bench and could not be gone
into.

10.

Apparently the cases relied on by the petitioner do not support

the plea of the petitioner that though the petitioner has remedy under
Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, this Court should entertain the
writ petition. In Ambica Quarry Works v. State of Gujarat and Ors.
MANU /SC /0049/1986 the Supreme Court had observed:"The ratio of any decision must be understood in the
background of the facts of that case. It has been said long
time ago that a case is only an authority for what it
actually decides, and not what logically follows from it."
Similarly in Bhavnagar University v. Palitana Sugar Mills Pvt
Ltd (2003) 2 SC 111 (vide para 59), the Supreme Court had observed:" It is well settled that a little difference in facts or
additional facts may make a lot of difference in the
precedential value of a decision."

This is no more res integra that a case is only an authority for
what it decides. As observed by the Supreme Court in State of Orissa
v. Sudhansu Sekhar Misra MANU/SC/0047/1967:WP (C) 2128 of 1997

Page 7 of 11

"A decision is only an authority for what it actually
decides. What is of the essence in a decision is its
ratio and not every observation found therein nor
what logically follows from the various observations
made in it.

11.

Apparently

the

case

relied

on

by

the

petitioner

are

distinguishable and on the basis of ratio of said cases it cannot be
held that this Court should exercise jurisdiction under Article 226 of
the Constitution of India and should entertain the writ petition
regarding the grievance of the petitioner that he should be granted
seniority from 1990 when he was allegedly not selected though he was
in priority grade I as has been alleged by him.

12.

Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, relied

on (2002) 4 SCC 145, Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan and another vs.
Subhas Sharma, holding

that under the Administrative Tribunals

Act, 1985, the Central Administrative Tribunals has exclusive
jurisdiction as court of first instance in relation to service matters
concerning the employees of Kendriya Vidyalaya despite the fact that
the jurisdiction of High Court under Article 226/227 of the
Constitution of India under corresponding provisions was not
excluded. The Apex Court had held that the High Court should not
WP (C) 2128 of 1997

Page 8 of 11

and cannot directly entertain a writ petition concerning service
matters of such employees of such organizations in respect of which
there is a notification under Section 14(2) of the Administrative
Tribunals Act, 1985.

It was held that the Administrative Tribunals

Act, 1985, Section 1(2)(a) applies to all Central Government servants.

13.

In the present circumstances, this cannot be disputed by the

petitioner that the provisions of Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985
are applicable to the case of the petitioner, as he is claiming that he
should be granted seniority from 1990 as Assistant Superintendent in
Tihar Jail as his non selection in 1990 was not illegal as he was
priority grade I candidate. In Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (supra),
it was held by the Apex Court relying on L. Chandra Kumar case that
it is not open for a litigant to directly approach the High Court even in
cases where they question the vires of statutory legislation by
overlooking the jurisdiction of the Tribunal concerned. The relevant
observation of the Apex Court in the case of Kendirya Vidyalaya
Sangathan page 151 are as under:“ 99.
..... it will not, therefore, be open for litigants to
directly approach the High courts even in cases where
they question the vires of statutory legislations (except
where the legislation which creates the particular Tribunal
is challenged) by overlooking the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal concerned. Section 5(6) of the Act is valid and
constitutional and is to be interpreted in the manner we
WP (C) 2128 of 1997

Page 9 of 11

have indicated.”

14.

This petition was filed by the petitioner after coming into the

force of the Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985.

The petitioner,

therefore, ought to have filed the petition before the Central
Administrative Tribunal. In terms of the decision of the Apex court,
Mr.T.K. Rangarajan (supra), there are no such “very very exceptional
circumstances” which will entail interference by this Court under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India. For the foregoing reasons,
even if this Court has jurisdiction, I do not find it to be a fit case to
exercise the writ jurisdiction ignoring and overlooking the jurisdiction
of Central Administrative Tribunal under the Administrative Tribunals
Act, 1985 which Tribunal is a court of first instance in relation to
service matters.

15.

For the foregoing reasons it will not be just and appropriate for

this Court to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226 when the
jurisdiction is with the Central Administrative Tribunal under the
Administrative Tribunals Act, 1986. In the circumstances this petition
be sent to Central Administrative Tribunal as this petition is pending
since 1997 and the petitioner has contended that he is on the verge of
his retirement. The Central Administrative Tribunal shall be entitled
WP (C) 2128 of 1997

Page 10 of 11

to decide all the pleas and contentions raised by the parties. The
registry of this Court is directed to send this matter to the Central
Administrative Tribunal. The parties are directed to appear before the
Central Administrative Tribunal on 24th March, 2008. Considering the
facts and circumstances, the parties are also left to bear their own
costs
