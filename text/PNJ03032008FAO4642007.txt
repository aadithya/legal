injunction. Interim relief prayed for was to restrain the
defendants from alienating or encumbering 20 acres of land in
Village Rangpuri.
3.

Briefly stated, case of the appellant is that first

respondent, impleaded as defendant No.1 is a company
incorporated

under

the

Companies

Act

and

approximately 20 acres of land in Village Rangpuri.

owns
That

respondents 2 to 4, impleaded as defendants 2 to 4 were the
directors of the company and were desirous of developing the
land owned by the company by constructing a motel and
service apartments thereon. It was pleaded that in the month
of May and June, 1996 the respondent No.1, through its
directors desired financial participation in the implementation
of its project and accordingly appellant and said defendants
entered into a MOU dated 25.6.1996.

Salient features of the

MOU were that land price was fixed at Rs.8001/- per sq. yd.
and that within 30 days appellant would obtain necessary
permissions/sanctions for construction of a motel and service
apartment.

That plaintiff would invest money for the

construction and would pay Rs.2 crores to the defendants at
the time of the signing of the MOU. Further Rs.5 crores would
also be paid up front when plans were approved. That after
construction of the service apartments was over, the same
FAO No.464/2007

Page No.2 of 12

would be sold. That after refunding Rs.7 crores to the plaintiff,
the profits would be shared in the ratio 40% for the plaintiff
and remaining for the company.
4.

It was further pleaded that after the MOU was

signed, the defendants 1 to 4 approached one Union General
Company, 21-A, Shakespeare Sarani, impleaded as defendant
No.5, for finance which also became a partner in the project. It
was further alleged that on 8.7.1997 it was agreed to amend
the terms of the MOU and that on 30.8.1997 a fresh MOU was
entered into as per which instead of advancing Rs.2 crores,
only Rs.1 crore was to be advanced. Similarly, instead of Rs.5
crores to be pumped in when sanction was obtained, only Rs.1
crore would be pumped in. It was recorded that Rs.51 lacs
stood paid as advance and that Rs.49 lacs would be paid within
45 days. It was further alleged that further amendments were
incorporated when MOU dated 26.12.1997 was executed. That
as per amendment incorporated vide MOU dated 26.12.1997
Rs.49 lacs required to be paid as per MOU dated 30.8.1997
would be paid by 3.4.1998. It may be noted here that the said
MOU introduced a totally new term pertaining to 4 acres land
for which plaintiff was to hold negotiations with the owners
thereof and purchase the same.

It may be further recorded

here that relevance of said clause in the MOU remains a

has been recorded.
revised

MOU

It may further be noted that as per the

dated

26.12.1997

it

was

stipulated

that

construction would commence within 5 months.
5.

It was further pleaded that the Union General

Company Ltd., (impleaded as defendant No.5) cancelled the
agreement which it had entered into with defendant Nos.1 to 4
and filed a suit in the Calcutta High Court claiming refund of
Rs.51 lacs paid by it. It was further pleaded in the plaint that
after 4 years, plaintiff has managed to obtain necessary
clearances and that the defendants have turned dishonest. It
was pleaded that as a result of the agreements between the
parties, either a partnership has come into being or a joint
venture agreement has come into being. Prayer made in the
suit is as under :“a) Declaration that the plaintiff is a
partner in the partnership of the Joint
Venture/Project of construction of a 5 star
Hotel and service apartments on the land

Rnagpuri, Distt. South West, New Delhi,

and that in view of undertaking the

6.

In their written statement defendants 1 to 4 have

pleaded that the plaintiff is in default and no approval has been
obtained by the plaintiff pertaining to the project in question.
FAO No.464/2007

Page No.6 of 12

That plaintiff is in default, in that, only Rs.51 lacs have been
paid. Balance Rs.49 lacs payable as per the revised MOU has
not been paid. That plaintiff and defendant No.5 are one and
the same entity, in that, defendant No.5 is a company
controlled by the plaintiff. It is pleaded that the address
mentioned in the MOU dated 25.6.1996 being that of the
plaintiff is the same as the registered office of defendant No.5,
namely, 21-A, Shakespeare Sarani, Calcutta. Said defendants
pleaded that due to defaults committed by the plaintiff,
defendants 1 to 4 have suffered damages and hence have
forfeited Rs.51 lacs. It is further pleaded that on the same
payment, defendant No.5 had sued for recovery of Rs.51 lacs
in the Calcutta High Court and in respect thereof the
defendants have furnished a bank guarantee in sum of Rs.51
lacs as ordered by the Calcutta High Court.

It has been held that the partnership is not

same sum, defendant No.5, a company controlled by the

in support of the second reason given is that the plaintiff was
refusing to divulge the details of Rs.51 lacs which plaintiff
claims to have paid with further claim of the plaintiff that this
payment was different than Rs.51 lacs paid by defendant No.5.
8.

During arguments I restricted learned counsel for

the parties to make submissions other than submission relating
to whether as a result of the MOUs a partnership has come into
existence or not. My reason thereof was that the said issue is
a subject matter of a separate miscellaneous petition filed in
this court wherein order dated 11.10.2006 passed in the suit
between the parties is under challenge. Vide said order dated
11.10.2006, application under Order VII Rule 11 CPC filed by
the defendants for rejection of the plaint was dismissed. Prima
facie view taken was that the plaintiff has not sued as a
partner but has sued for a declaration that he be declared a
partner of the firm.
9.

Learned counsel for the parties fairly conceded that

said issue i.e. relating to the nature of the suit would be
decided in the petition challenging the order dated 11.10.2006.
10.

The principles of grant of ad-interim injunction are

well known. The trinity of prima facie case being established
by the plaintiff, irreparable loss and injury caused to the
FAO No.464/2007

Page No.8 of 12

plaintiff if injunction is refused and balance of convenience in
favour of the plaintiff need to be prima facie established before
a plaintiff succeeds in obtaining an interim injunction.
11.

On the issue of prima facie case suffice would it be

to state that the execution of the MOUs referred to in the plaint
has not been denied. However, it has to be noted that under
the revised MOU dated 26.12.1997 plaintiff was to pay Rs.1
crore in two stages. Rs.51 lacs stood paid. Rs.49 lacs had to be
paid by 3.4.1998. Said sum of Rs.49 lacs has admittedly not
been paid. Further, construction cost had to be borne by the
plaintiff.

Not a penny has been spent on construction.

Admittedly, only Rs.51 lacs have flown to the coffers of
defendant No.1. Even that sum of Rs.51 lacs is doubtful vis-avis the source thereof. It would be interesting to note that the
plaintiff claims to have paid Rs.51 lacs when the MOU dated
25.6.1996 was executed.

For a similar sum, defendant No.5

has laid claim for Rs.51 lacs to be refunded. Address of the
plaintiff disclosed in the MOU dated 25.6.1996 is 'resident of
21-A, Shakespeare Sarani, Calcutta'. The same is the address
of defendant No.5. It is important to note that when called
upon to disclose the particulars of how plaintiff paid Rs.51 lacs
to defendant No.1, plaintiff has failed to do so.
12.

Prima facie, plaintiff and defendant No.1 appear to

FAO No.464/2007

Page No.9 of 12

be staking a claim on the same sum of Rs.51 lacs.

Thus,

defendant No.5 having filed a suit in the Calcutta High Court
and having secured Rs.51 lacs in said suit, under a bank
guarantee, prima facie negates a prima facie case in favour of
the plaintiff herein in respect of the sum of Rs.51 lacs.
13.

It has further to be noted that the MOUs were signed

and revised between the year 1996 till the year 1997.
Necessary sanctions had to be obtained if not within 5 months
as stipulated in the last MOU dated 26.12.1997, at least within
a reasonable period of time.

Till date, sanctions from the

authorities has not seen the light of the day.
14.

As noted above, 20 acres of land belonging to

defendant no.1 was valued @ Rs.8001/- per sq. yd. Plaintiff's
contribution had to be in crores for the reason a motel and a
service apartment block had to be constructed on the land.
Thereafter, the parties were to share the profits as stipulated in
the memorandum of understandings.

It would be against

equity to injunct the defendants from dealing with their land
even assuming that plaintiff has parted with Rs.51 lacs for the
reason plaintiff's participation at this stage is too meager.
15.

The facet of prima facie case, in the facts and

circumstances, has an inherent feature of irreparable loss and
injury being caused to the defendant Nos.1 to 5 if injunction is
FAO No.464/2007

Page No.10 of 12

granted.
16.

As already noted above, plaintiff has prima facie

failed to satisfy this Court of having spent any money on the
project.
money

There is no evidence that plaintiff has spent any

from

Government

Departments. Defendant Nos.1 to 4 have received only Rs.51
lacs. Said sum of Rs.51 lacs has been secured in favour of
defendant No.5 in the suit filed by defendant No.5 in the
Calcutta High Court. In my opinion, non-grant of an injunction
would hardly cause any irreparable loss and injury to the
plaintiff which cannot be made good if the suit filed by the
plaintiff ultimately succeeds.
17.

On the issue of balance of convenience, suffice

would it be to state that @ Rs.8001/- per sq. yd. for 20 acres of
land, the value thereof comes to approximately Rs.77.6 crores.
Assuming plaintiff has paid Rs.51 lacs to the defendant Nos.1
to 4, his total contribution would be about 1% towards the
pooled assets. The balance of convenience clearly lies in favour
of defendant Nos. 1 to 4.
18.

The issue can be looked at from another angle. If

there exists a partnership between the parties, remedy of the
plaintiff is to sue for dissolution and rendition of accounts. If
such a suit is filed, that plaintiff contributed only Rs.51 lacs
FAO No.464/2007

Page No.11 of 12

towards the capital of the firm would obviously stare the
plaintiff in his face. The plaintiff would be entitled to return of
his capital. Indeed, partnership business has yielded no profits
till date. Thus, the capital i.e. the land under any circumstances
would revert to defendants 1 to 4.
19.

Alternatively, plaintiff may sue for damages. In said

suit it would

be a relevant consideration that plaintiff's

contribution has been meager.
20.

Looked at from any angle, no case is made out in

equity to grant the interim injunction prayed for by the plaintiff.
21.

The appeal is dismissed.

22.

Costs shall follow.
