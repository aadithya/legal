1.

This reference under Section 21(5) of the Chartered Accountants of

India Act, 1949 ('Act') is in respect of Respondent No.1 who is a Chartered
Accountant. A complaint was made by Rohit House Occupants Welfare
Association against Respondent No.1 on several counts. One of the grounds
was that the Respondent, who was an auditor of the complainant for the
financial years 1997-98 and 1998-99 had also written the books of account
of the complainant for those very financial years thus compromising his
independence as as a professional Chartered Accountant. The complaint
listed out other specific instances of the Respondent having either failed to
or having been grossly negligent in the discharge of his duties as a Chartered
Accountant.

It is stated by the Petitioner, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of

India ('ICAI'), that despite a copy of the complaint having been sent to
Respondent No.1 on 10th January, 2001 and a reminder on 18th February,
2002 requesting him to send his written statement, Respondent No.1 did not
respond. Thereafter, in terms of

Regulation 12 (11) of the Chartered

Accountants Regulations, 1988 the Council of the ICAI considered the
complaint at its meeting held in April 2003 and formed a prima facie opinion
that the Respondent No.1 was guilty of
misconduct.

professional and/or other

The case was referred to the Disciplinary Committee

('Committee') for enquiry.

3.

The case was fixed for hearing before the Committee on 5 th November,

2003. Despite notice being sent to Respondent No.1, he did not appear
before the Committee on that date. The enquiry was therefore completed ex
parte. On 4th February, 2004 the Committee submitted its report in which it
expressed an opinion that the Respondent No.1 was guilty of professional
misconduct within the meaning of Clauses 6,7,8 and 9 of Part I of the
Second Schedule to the Act. It was opined that Respondent No.1 was also
guilty of “other misconduct” under Section 22 read with Section 21 of the
Act.

4.

A copy of the report was forwarded to both parties on 27th May, 2004

and they were informed that it would be considered in the forthcoming
meetings of the Council.

They were requested to send their written

comments and if, they so desired, to appear before the Council. By a letter
CHAT.A.REF. 9 of 2005

dated 9th June, 2004 the parties were informed that the report of the
Disciplinary Committee could be considered by the Council on 25th June,
2004. A further intimation was sent on 6th July, 2004 that the report would
be considered at the next meeting of the Council on 22 nd July, 2004. Despite
these communications neither the complainant nor the Respondent No.1
responded. Neither sent any representation.

5.

At the meeting held between 20th and 23rd July, 2004, the Council

considered and accepted the report of the Disciplinary Committee.

It

decided to recommend to this Court that the name of the Respondent No.1
be removed from the Register of Members for a period of one year.
Thereafter, in terms of Section 21(5) of the Act, the case was forwarded to
this Court.

6.

Notice was directed to issue to both Respondent No.1 and the Central

Government Respondent No.2 by this Court on 14 th November, 2005. Fresh
notice was further directed on 9th October 2006 and 16th July, 2007. Dasti
service was also permitted. An affidavit of service has been filed confirming
that service on Respondent No.1 is complete. However, at the final hearing
on 19th September, 2007 none appeared for Respondent No.1 despite the case
having been called out twice.

7.

On a perusal of the records, this Court finds that the Disciplinary

Committee was justified in its conclusion that the Respondent No.1 was
guilty of professional misconduct and other misconduct as indicated in its
report. The averments made in the complaint having been supported by
CHAT.A.REF. 9 of 2005

page 3 of 4

sufficient material, the Committee concluded that it was established that
Respondent No.1 had violated the code of conduct governing the members
of the ICAI.

8.

This Court finds no infirmity in the conclusion arrived at by the

Committee which has been accepted by the Council.

Accordingly, the

recommendation made by the Council of ICAI that the Respondent No.1 be
removed from the Register of its Members for a period of one year is hereby
accepted and it is so directed.

9.

The reference is disposed of.
