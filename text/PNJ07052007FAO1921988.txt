PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Appellants are the widow, sons and grand parents of

the deceased late Shri Raja Ram. When the claim petition was
filed on 19.10.1985, the widow of the deceased was aged 24
years.

Minor sons were aged 4 years and 1 Â½ years

respectively. Grand-father was aged 75 years. Age of the grandmother of the deceased has not come on record.

2.

22 years have gone by.

When questioned whether

the grand parents are alive, the

learned counsel for the

appellants stated that she does not know.

Adjournment was

prayed for.
3.

Since the matter relates to an accident which took

place in the 1985 and the appeal has remained pending in this
Court since the year 1988 I had thought it advisable not to
adjourn the matter. I had heard the arguments.
4.

By and under the impugned award dated 26.7.1988,

claim petition has been dismissed principally on the ground that
the alleged eyewitness, PW-3, Chittar Singh was a planted
witness.
noting

The finding has been returned by the learned Judge
material

discrepancies

and

inconsistency

in

the

deposition of Chittar Singh and investigating officer, SI Phool
Chand who were examined as PW-4.
5.

It is not in dispute that Raja Ram was found dead on

the road at S.P.Marg at around 8:30 PM on 5.8.1985. The post
mortem report Ex.PW1/A evidences injury caused by impact of a
vehicle on the person of the deceased.
6.

According

to

the

appellants,

the

accident

was

witnessed by Chittar Singh, PW-3.

Page 2 of 14

7.

In his examination-in-chief, Chittar Singh stated that

he saw the accident as he was standing at the Fatehpuri bus
stop.

He stated that bus No.DHP-2480 was the offending

vehicle. He stated that he saw a man crossing the road. That
the bus came speeding at 60 Kms per hour to 70 Kms per hour.
It was being driven in a zig-zag manner.

After hitting the

deceased, the driver stopped for a while and then sped away.
He stated that 4 or 5 other persons were present at the bus
stop.

He stated that he recollected name of one person,

namely, Rameshwar Dayal. He stated that he did not inform the
police about the accident.

He categorically stated that the

police never contacted him. That Rameshwar Dayal came to his
office and took him to the police station when he disclosed the
number of the bus. In cross-examination he stated that he did
not know where Rameshwar Dayal resides or works. He stated
that Rameshwar Dayal came to him on 7.8.1985 at his
workplace at the Railway Station. He further stated that after
the accident he remained at the spot for 20 to 25 minutes.
Police did not come to the spot as along as he remained there.
8.

SI Phool Chand who conducted the investigation

appeared as PW-4 and stated that at about 8:45 PM, on

Page 3 of 14

5.8.1985 he received a copy of DD Entry No.17-A and pursuant
thereto he accompanied by Const. Samay Pal Singh left for the
site of the accident. On reaching the site of the accident they
found the deceased lying dead. He stated that it was raining
and no eyewitness was available. He stated that based on the
daily diary entry No.17 and what he saw at the spot he sent a
rukka for registering an FIR under Section 279/304.A IPC.
stated that he sent the dead body for postmortem.

He

He stated

that he continued with the investigation on 6.8.1985 by going
back to the spot. He questioned people around the area and
met Chittar Singh who told him that the previous night he had
witnessed the accident.

That he disclosed the number of the

bus as DHP-2480 plying on Route No.131.
9.

Learned Judge has noted that in the record of

investigation conducted by the police there is no reference to
any Rameshwar Dayal, the person named by Chittar Singh being
the one who took him to the police.

Learned Judge has further

noted that whereas Chitter Singh categorically stated that
Rameshwar Dayal came to him on 7.8.1985, i.e. 2 days after the
accident, and took him to the police station for having his
statement recorded, SI Phool Singh disclosed completely

Page 4 of 14

different facts of having come into contact with Chittar Singh.
As noted above, SI Phool Chand categorically deposed that he
met Chittar Singh, the day next after the accident, i.e. 6.8.1985,
when he was making investigations at the spot.
10.

Further, the learned Trial Judge has found it to be a

case of abnormal behaviour, if indeed Chittar Singh had
witnessed the accident, learned Judge has opined that normal
human conduct would be to inform the police and try and render
medical aid to the injured.
11.

Noting the discrepancy in the testimony of Chittar

Singh and SI Phool Chand and noting it to be a case of abnormal
human conduct of an eyewitness, learned Judge has disbelieved
that Chittar Singh witnessed the accident.
12.

Unfortunately, neither before the learned Trial Judge,

nor before me, counsel for the claimants made an endeavour to
scrutinize the record with a hawk's eye.
13.

More often than not, truth lies hidden in nooks and

corners. It discloses itself to a prying eye.
14.

A penetrative look at the FIR, Ex.PW 2/A reveals a lot.

15.

I am a little handicapped for the reason DD entry

No.17-A dated 5.8.1985 which set into motion the process of

Page 5 of 14

investigation has not been brought on record.

As would be

evident from my discussion hereinafter, said DD entry would
have revealed a lot.
16.

However, the FIR, EX.PW2/A throws a lot of light on

the issue at hand.
17.

The FIR has been recorded at 9:45 PM on 5.8.1985

pursuant to the rukka sent from the spot by PW-4, SI Phool
Chand. The FIR makes a reference to the contents of DD Entry
No.17-A dated 5.8.1985. The FIR commences as under :'On 8:45 PM telephonic information has been
received from the PCR van from SI Todar Mal that
Head Const. Puri has been informed by an unknown
messenger that a DTC bus No.2405 or 2408, plying
on Route No.131 has run over a man near
Fatehpuri.'
18.

Further contents of the F.I.R. need not be noted for

the reason they refer to the rukka sent by SI Phool Chand.
19.

Nobody bothered to read the contents of EX.PW2/A,

i.e. the FIR.
20.

A contemporaneous information has been recorded

through unknown messenger that a person has been run over by
a DTC bus plying on Route No.131, number of the bus was either
2405 or 2408.
21.

The driver of the bus, Sant Ram has stepped into the
Page 6 of 14

witness box as RW-1. In his examination-in-chief he stated that
on 5.8.1985 he was the driver of bus No.DHP-2480. That the
bus was plying on Route No.131 from Fatehpuri to Lampur
Border. He further stated that his route timing from Fatehpuri
used to normally commence at 8:40 PM but on 5.8.1985 he was
asked to proceed for his journey at 8:30 PM as the earlier bus
had not reported.
22.

Testimony of RW-1 establishes that bus No.DHP-2480

was plying on Route No.131 and Fatehpuri was on the route.
The testimony further establishes the presence of the bus at
Fatehpuri i.e. the starting point of the journey at 8:30 PM.
23.

The FIR has been registered at 9:45 PM. the DD entry

17-A has been recorded by the local police on 8:45 PM.

The

timing of the registration of DD entry 17-A is important. It is
further important to note that the unknown messenger who
gave information to the PCR van disclosed that a man has been
run over by a DTC bus plying on Route No.131 and that the
number of the bus was either 2405 or 2408.
24.

The bus which has been alleged to be the offending

vehicle bears No.DHP-2480.
25.

We have 3 numbers before us: 2405, 2408 and 2480.

Page 7 of 14

26.

It is important to note that the accident took place

around 8:30 PM.

It is also important to note that in his

testimony, SI Phool Chand has stated that when he reached the
spot, it was raining. Thus, the informant could have committed
an error in correctly noting the number of the bus. But what is
relevant is that the informant gave the route number displayed
by the bus. As noted above, RW-1, the driver of bus No.DHP2480 admitted that his bus was plying on route No.131 and was
at Fatehpuri at 8:30 PM.
27.

I am satisfied that there is enough evidence on

record to satisfy the standard of proof required to be achieved in
a trial in a claim petition under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939.
28.

Notwithstanding the fact that the discrepancy in the

testimony of Chittar Singh, the so called eyewitness and SI Phool
Chand

renders

suspect

the

testimony

of

both,

but

the

contemporaneous facts noted in the FIR, EX.PW2/A as found
recorded in DD entry No.17-A are enough to bring out the truth.
29.

I accordingly hold that it has been established by the

evidence on record that the deceased died due to being hit by
bus No.DHP-2480 belonging to DTC.
30.

Site Plan Ex.PW4/A where the dead body was found

Page 8 of 14

evidences that on the main stretch of Shyama Prasad Mukerje
Marg near the Central Verge, the deceased was hit by a motor
vehicle. The place of accident is a straight road. The driver of
the bus could not have seen a pedestrian on the road.
31.

Post mortem report Ex. PW1/A

shows multiple

fracture of bones at various places. It records that the brain is
lacerated. Internal organs were damaged. There was blood in
the lungs.
32.

The post mortem report shows that the deceased was

hit with sufficient momentum. The nature of injuries evidence
the speed with which the bus was being driven. The post
mortem report evidences that the bus was being driven at a
high speed, meaning thereby, rashly.
33.

On the issue of loss of dependence, testimony of PW-

8 Ram Niwas Kardam, UDC DDA has to be looked into. PW-6
deposed that the deceased was working as a 'Khalasi' in DDA.
He was appointed on 15.12.1976. When he died, deceased was
earning monthly salary of Rs.927.55. That as per record, date of
birth of the deceased was 1.3.1956. That Class -IV employees
retire at the age of 58 years.
34.

The accident took place on 5.8.1985. The deceased

Page 9 of 14

was born on 1.3.1956. Thus, he was nearing the age of 30 years
when he died. He could have served till the age of 58 years,
meaning

thereby,

he

had

further

28

gainful

years

of

employment.
35.

There is no evidence on record as to what was the

scale of 'Khalasi', i.e. the post held by the deceased.
36.

A fact needs to be noted. With effect from 1.1.1986,

with the implementation of 4th Pay Commission, there was
quantum jump in wages. Thereafter, with the implementation of
the 5th Pay

Commission recommendation, there was further

quantum jump in wages with effect from 1.1.1996.
37.

Therefore, I would not be unjustified if I treat that by

the end of his service career, income of the deceased would
have risen four folds. Thus, the mean average income of the
deceased comes to Rs.2318.87 (rounded off to Rs.2300/-) per
month.
38.

The parents of the deceased had pre-deceased him.

Wife, minor children and grand parents of the deceased were
dependent upon him.
39.

Thus, dependents would be the wife and the 2 minor

sons who, as noted above, were aged 4 years and 1 Â½ years

Page 10 of 14

when the deceased died.
40.

Keeping in view the age of the deceased, i.e. 30

years and that of

dependents, wife being 24 years and the

minor sons being 4 years and 1 Â½ years respectively, in the light
of the decisions reported as :(i)

U.P.State Road Transport Corporation Vs. Krishna Bala &

Ors., (2006) 6 SCC 249

(vii) New India Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Satendar & Ors., JT 2006
(10) SC 234.
I adopt the multiplier 14.
41.

Latest decision on the issue has been pronounced by

the Supreme Court on 8.3.2007 reported as 2007 AIR SCW 1884

Page 11 of 14

Managing Director, TNSTC Vs. Sripriya. In the said case, for a
deceased

aged 32 to 33 years, Supreme Court has been

applying the multiplier of 13.
42.

While adopting the multiplier I have taken into

consideration that the elder son of the deceased would have
found gainful employment in the next 18 years and the younger
son would have been gainfully employed in the next 21 years.
That the widow would need t o be recompensed dependence till
as long as she lived.

I have considered the effect of

capitalization of future earnings.
43.

Taking 1/3rd as the personal expenses of the

deceased, loss of dependence comes to Rs.1533.41 per month.
Annual loss of dependence comes to Rs.18,400.92. Applying
multiplier 14, loss of dependence comes to Rs.2,57,612.88
(rounded off to Rs.2,58,000/-).
44.

Granting conventional damages of Rs.2000/- as

funeral expenses and Rs.15,000/- for loss of consortium for wife
and loss of love and affection to the minor children, total
compensation payable is determined as Rs.2,75,000/-.
45.

Considering that the claim petition was filed in the

year 1985 when scheduled banks were offering interest @ 12%

Page 12 of 14

p.a. on fixed deposits which rate fluctuated between 10% p.a.
to 12% p.a. till the year 2000. Thereafter, rate of accident fell
as low as 5.5% in the year 2006 and has since risen to 8.5% p.a.
I direct that on the sum awarded, interest would be payable to
the appellants @ 7.5% p.a. from the date of claim petition till
date of payment.
46.

Needless to state, since bus belonged to DTC, liability

to satisfy the award would be joint and several of DTC, as owner
and Sant Ram, the driver of the bus impleaded as respondent
No.2.
47.

Not knowing whether the grand parents are alive or

not and assuming that they are alive, both would be nearing 100
years, and if alive, would be looked after by their daughter-inlaw and grand children, I am not directing any payment to the
grand parents because it would create procedural difficulty in
the 2 withdrawing the monthly interest as I intend to secure the
amount awarded by keeping it in a fixed deposit.
48.

The compensation, together with accrued interest till

date of payment shall be apportioned as under :(a)

Wife of the deceased

........

(b)

Both sons of the deceased ........

50%
25% each

Page 13 of 14

49.

The money payable would be retained in a fixed

deposit for a period of 5 years from the date of deposit. Deposit
would be with a nationalized bank. The wife and the sons of the
deceased would be permitted to withdraw monthly, quarterly or
half yearly interest as would be the term of the deposit.
50.

No costs.
