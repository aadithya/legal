1.
The petitioner joined as Constable (Driver) in CRPF on
04.04.1995.

He was transferred to CRPF (RAF – Rapid Action

Force) 107 Battalion, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh on 27.09.1997. It
is alleged that Sh. R.K. Parihar, Assistant Commandant used to
harass the petitioner on one pretext or the other. He would time
and again summon the petitioner to order lee room and make him
stand at the door for hours. The petitioner in vain tried to bring
the same to the notice of the Sub-Ordinate M.T. Transport Officer.
On 04.01.2001 above said Sh. R.K. Parihar used the abusive
language and the petitioner paid him with the same coin.

The

petitioner brought these facts to the notice of Sh. K. Yadav, AOD,
Deputy Commandant. On the contrary, the petitioner was
threatened by Sh. K.S. Yadav. The petitioner then wrote to the
superior officer.

The petitioner filed a written complaint dated

08.01.2001 to Inspector General of Police and Deputy Inspector
General of Police, RAF (CRPF), R.K. Puram, Delhi.

The DIG

directed the then commandant to enquire about the above said
complaint.
2.

No enquiry was ever held and the complaint was sent to

Sh.Z.F. Khan, the then Commandant, a superior officer.
WP(C) No.4654/2003

It was

reported that the complaint sent by the petitioner was false. The
petitioner was held guilty

of

indiscipline

for sending the

complaint to superiors directly and a penalty of five days
confinement to lines and pack drill for one hour per day was
inflicted upon the petitioner. No enquiry was held in this context.
The petitioner, who was away to Bhuj to assist in measures
arranged to help the earthquack victims, was never called for the
purposes of the enquiry.

The salary of the petitioner was

deducted for five days. Commandant CRPF/RAF, respondent No.3
asserted that the petitioner did not undergo the line confinement.
The petitioner admits that he could not undergo the punishment
of 30 kg pack drill as he was at that time under treatment by the
Unit CMO, who prescribed him to take medicines for ten days but
the respondent no. 3 was, inhumanly, pressing for the pack drill
part of the punishment.

The petitioner was

suspended on 04.05.2001 for not undergoing the punishment.
The said suspension was, however, revoked by the respondents
after about 13-14 months.
WP(C) No.4654/2003

The petitioner joined back on
Page 3 of 12

31.05.2002 when the re-inquiry was ordered and continued to
serve till the petitioner was illegally removed and sent back home
by the impugned order.
4.

It is alleged that all the questions were put by the enquiry

officer to elicit the desired result/answer. It is averred that as a
matter of fact the questions put by the enquiry officer were so
leading that the whole enquiry stands vitiated. For few months
the result of the enquiry was not declared and eventually the said
enquiry was declared closed without recording any finding on the
basis of some procedural technicality and 'de-novo' re-inquiry was
ordered by DIG, RAF(CRPF). Although, the re-inquiry was barred
by delay and laches, yet, the same enquiry was conducted
without serving the petitioner and at his back. The said enquiry
officer did not consider the statements of witnesses who had
earlier in the first round of enquiry deposed in favour of the
petitioner nor did he summon them to throw light on the charges
levelled against the petitioner in violation of Rule 27(c)(5) of CRPF
Rules, 1955.
5.

It was explained that previously, too, the petitioner silently

suffered the punishment awarded to him.

On 26.10.2000, the

Diwali day, Constable Sh. Balram Singh, fitter, fell down on an iron
WP(C) No.4654/2003

Page 4 of 12

box under the influence of liquor.

A false complaint was

registered against the petitioner and he was charged with causing
injury to said Sh. Balram Singh. The alleged complainant, Balram
Singh, himself, admitted that he got injury himself by falling on
the rough rocky surface while he was in an inebriated state as he
had consumed liquor because he was in celebration mood of
Diwali.

However, the enquiry officer found that charge stood

proved and imposed a penalty of seven days confinement of the
petitioner to the lines and deduction of seven days salary besides
disallowing food from mess for seven days.
6.

The petitioner was dismissed from service vide order dated

24.12.2002.

The appeal preferred by him was dismissed on

18.01.2003.

Aggrieved by that order the present writ petition

was filed with the following prayers :
“(i) declare that the first inquiry by the
respondent no. 3 was itself abuse of power
and particularly the re-inquiry was illegal
and void ab-initio;
(ii) declare that the finding of the inquiry
officer is perverse and based on no
evidence;
(iii) set aside and quash the order of
removal from service dated 24.12.2002
passed by the Commandant, CRPF 107,
Battalion, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh as also
WP(C) No.4654/2003

Page 5 of 12

the order of the
confirming the same.

7.

Appellate

Authority

(iv) direct the respondent to reinstate the
petitioner back in the service with back
wages and consequential benefits;”
The defence set-up by the respondents in the counter

affidavit is this. Previously, too, the petitioner was awarded the
following punishments. On 16.05.1999, the petitioner was absent
from his Sentry duty in the M.T. Garage and had left his post and
gone to his house for which he was appropriately punished by the
Commandant by awarding him three days confinement to the line
with forfeiture of pay and allowances with one hour punishment
drill.

Again on 21.10.2000, the petitioner quarelled with

Constable Balram under the influence of liquor and had assaulted
him. The petitioner awarded punishment by Sh. B.S. Rathore for
seven days confinement to the line with forfeiture of pay and
allowances when the Commandant was away from the unit of
Bawana. It was explained, “Shri Jarnail Singh, D/C was appointed
as Enquiry Officer, but the Enquiry Officer had submitted DE
proceedings and therein certain observations have been noticed
and DE proceedings returned to him but the EO failed to complete
DE as per instructions contained in S/o 20/01”.

Thereafter the

enquiry was marked to Shri B.S. Rathore, who previously, too, had
WP(C) No.4654/2003

Page 6 of 12

awarded the punishment to the petitioner.
objected to it.

The petitioner

The DIGP, RAF cancelled the order of D.E. and

ordered de novo departmental enquiry. During de novo enquiry
the

behaviour

of

the

petitioner

remained

non-

cooperative/obstinate and he did not produce material evidence
in his defence. It was explained that the other allegations made
against the respondents are wrong, misleading and misconceived
and therefore vehemently denied.

We have heard the counsel for the parties.

counsel

for

the

respondents

vehemently

The learned

argued

that

the

petitioner is a habitual drinker, disobedient, incorrigible and a
non-cooperative person. The CRPF, which is a disciplined force
has no option but to lower the boom with such offenders. Again,
the counsel for the respondents pointed out that Sh. R.K. Parihar
is not a party and such like allegation should be made in presence
of Sh. R.K. Parihar.

Again the record shows that the petitioner

was declared medically fit.
9.

We have marshalled the record produced before us.

The

CRPF case is full of holes as a sieve. To top it all, the petitioner
has placed on record the photocopy of the medical report dated
18.04.2001. The said medical report reveals that the petitioner
WP(C) No.4654/2003

Page 7 of 12

had pain in chest on 18.04.2001. He was referred to Hamidiya
Hospital, Bhopal for check up. Photocopy of the OPD pertaining to
Hamidiya Hospital has also been filed wherein, the Doctor
advised “for review for investigation”.

The photocopies of

Reference Register Unit Hospital 107 BN RAF w.e.f. 01.01.1999 to
31.12.2002 were also placed on the record. These reveal that on
19.04.2000,

20.04.2001,

21.04.2001

and

23.04.2001,

the

petitioner was suffering from chest pain and was referred to
Hamidiya Hospital.
10.

Now, we turn to the Appellate order dated April 2003. The

defence of the petitioner was dealt in para no. 6 of the Appellate
order, which runs as follows :
“(6) Appellant has stated that he was sick
during the orderly room and Doctor had
given him medicines therefore he could not
undergo pack drill. But this statement of
appellant is wrong and baseless because he
was M.D from sick report on 23.04.2002. If
he was sick he should have gone again to
sick report and could be admitted to the
hospital. But he did not do so, which makes
it appear that his statement is wrong and
baseless.”
The defence of the petitioner has been that he was not
physically fit on account of illness to undergo the punishment of
back drill punishment. There is no finding by the authority who

WP(C) No.4654/2003

Page 8 of 12

has passed the order of removal or by the Appellate Authority to
the effect that the defence set-up by the petitioner to the charge
of disobedience was factually incorrect. The appellate order
quoted above is contrary to the record already detailed above.
This leads us to inextricable confusion. How a sick person can be
compelled to undergo such like strenuous exercise.

Even the

disciplined force like CRPF is not excepted to have such like rules.
This has put a large question mark over the bona fides of all
concerned officers. Could not the concerned officer wait for few
days and ask the petitioner to undergo the punishment when he
was medically fully fit.

Was he bent upon to harrass the

petitioner. Did not he make an attempt to execute the orders by
hook or crook.

The court has to view such like evidence with

intense suspicion.
11.

Our attention was also drawn towards statement made by

Constable/fitter Rambir Singh, who appeared as a defence
witness. His following statement was recorded :
“I, Ct/fitter Rambir Singh force No.
910100212 had gone to see Adjutant 107
on 4.1.2001 in connection with leave, there
Ct./Dvr., Darshan Singh was already present
before
Shri
R.K.
Parihar
(Asstt.
Commandant). Before my arrival, Shri R.K.
Parihar was in anger on some issue,
WP(C) No.4654/2003

Page 9 of 12

between these two, who hurled abuses of
mother and sister to Ct./Dvr. Darshan Singh
and threatened to break his leg and also
said to kill and further said that I cancel
your family permission and how you go to
see your child. I don't have to say anything
further.
Above statement is read over,
explained and admitted to be correct.”
Statement of Randhir Singh, defence witness was also
recorded. He also made the following statement :
“I Constable/Driver Randhir Singh Force
No.940280101 state that Shri R.K. Parihar
hurled abuses, using mother and sister to
Ct./Dvr., Darshan Singh in my presence and
said that give application to Prime Minister
what you can do to me.”
Emphasis supplied
No finding is given on the statements made by these two
witnesses. These facts further put another spoke in the wheel of
doubt.
12.

The office order dated 29.01.2001 shows that Commandant

had ordered that “out living family pension in respect of Darshan
Singh is hereby canceled w.e.f. 05.01.2001”. This goes to show
that the pension was cancelled retrospectively w.e.f. 05.01.2001.
It adds further dimensions of respondents' problem.
13.

The respondents have failed to prove to the satisfaction of

WP(C) No.4654/2003

Page 10 of 12

this court as to why de novo enquiry was held, why the record of
first enquiry was not considered, why defence witnesses were
disbelieved etc. Despite explanations given by the respondents,
it is clear that the distance between illusion and reality is
unbridgeable.

The respondents have made a vain attempt to

make bricks with straw.
14.

In V. Ramana Vs. A.P.S.R.T.C. & Ors, JT 2005 (8) SC 134, it

was held :
“7. Lord Greene said in 1948 in the
famous Wednesbury case, 1948 (1) KB 223
that when a statute gave discretion to an
administrator to take a decision, the scope
of judicial review would remain limited. He
said that interference was not permissible
unless one or the other of the following
conditions was satisfied, namely the order
was contrary to law, or relevant factors were
not considered, or irrelevant factors were
considered; or the decision was one which
no reasonable person could have taken.
These principles were consistently followed
in the UK and in India to judge the validity of
administrative action.
It is equally well
known that in 1983, Lord Diplock in Council
for Civil Services Union v. Minister of Civil
Services, 1983 1 AC 768 (called the CCSU
case) summarized the principles of judicial
review of administrative action as based
upon one or other of the following viz.,
illegality,
procedural
irregularity
and
irrationality.
He, however, opined that
“proportionality” was a 'future possibility'.

WP(C) No.4654/2003

Page 11 of 12

15.

Under these circumstances, we find that the punishment

awarded to the petitioner is shockingly disproportionate.

We

accordingly set aside the order passed by the authority below,
restore the service of the petitioner along with back wages and
other consequential benefits.
