1.

The plaintiff seeks a declaration against defendant No.1 –

Delhi Financial Corporation (hereinafter referred to as `DFC')
declaring that it has no right to recover the principal or interest on
amount advanced or on the balance amount to be released i.e., the
sum of Rs.11 lacs.

A consequential decree for injunction has been

claimed against the DFC directing them to release the balance
sanctioned amount to the plaintiff and to open the seal of the
CS(OS) No. 1824/1992

Financial Corporation of India, 1952 (hereinafter referred to as `Act).
2.

The plaintiff was sanctioned a term loan for purchase of

machinery, for the purpose of execution of contract with the Ministry
of Information & Broadcasting. The plaintiff was registered as a small
scale industry.

it deposited Rs.3,45,588.92 with the Gujarat

Communication &

Electronics Ltd. towards 25% advance for booking the equipment.
5.

It is claimed that the defendant proceeded to take action

under Section 29 of the Act, without notice,

arbitrarily sealed the

premises and took over possession on 17.07.1987 within 1½ months
of its inauguration.

The Punjab National Bank is alleged to have

suspended further working capital on 09.12.1987 and the plaintiff at
that time had availed the credit facilities only to the tune of Rs.2.2
lacs. It is alleged that the action taken by the defendant resulted in
considerable loss and the plaintiff was unable to go ahead with its
business and commercial activities.
6.

The plaintiff avers,

funds and also appointment of a technical expert by DFC to look into
various aspects.

According to the plaintiff the said expert had

was issued by the defendant threatening to take possession of the

Page No. 3 of 12

unit. The plaintiff alleges that the defendant committed defaults right
from the inception and he was, therefore, deprived of all the funds at
the relevant time.

Therefore, the decree for declaration and

injunction has been sought for having claim.
7.

In the written statement the defendant has denied the material

averments.

It alleges about disbursing amounts released by the

Industrial Development Bank of India and the Small Industries
Development Bank of India.

The plaintiff had been sanctioned

Rs.33.20 lacs for which a Mortgage Deed was executed. According to
the defendant the plaintiff breached the agreement right from the
inception and did not pay the installments in time.

In these

circumstances, it is claimed that a show cause notice under Section
29 was issued on 19.12.1988 itself. The defendant also avers that the
plaintiff requested for deferment of the installment by one year on the
condition that he undertook to remit a sum of Rs.75,000/- per month
from December, 1989. It is alleged that this arrangement and terms
of the agreement too was defaulted. According to the defendant the
outstanding amounts due from the borrowers as on 01.11.1991, was
Rs.40,93,711.46 and as on the date of filing of the written statement
the total sum due exceeded Rs.46 lakhs.

It, therefore, justifies the

action and further state about issuance of a notice under Section 29
on 24.12.1992. The defendant filed a criminal complaint alleging that

CS(OS) No. 1824/1992

Page No. 4 of 12

the plaintiff was guilty of committing offences under Section 406.
8.

During the pendency of these proceedings the entirety of the

principal amount due and disbursed to the plaintiff was repaid. This
fact was noticed on 29.07.1993 when the statement of the plaintiff's
Managing Director was recorded, evidencing repayment of Rs.5 lacs.
On 24.09.1993 the following order was recorded:-

"Learned counsel for the parties submit that
payment with regard to principal amount has already
been made by the plaintiff to the defendant.
The
premises have been desealed and have been handed over
to the plaintiff.
Learned counsel for the defendant
submits that one vehicle has already been released to the
plaintiff.
Learned counsel for the plaintiff further
submits that the plaintiff has disposed of the machinery
and thereafter made the payment of the principal
amount.
Learned counsel further submits that the
plaintiff undertakes not to dispose of the immovable
property mortgaged in favour of the defendantCorporation, till the disposal of the suit. It may, however,
be clarified that the arrangement arrived at between the
parties is without prejudice to rights and contentions of
the parties. Learned counsel for the defendant also
submits that the defendant-Corporation will not take any
coercive steps during the pendency of this suit.
Learned counsel for the parties also agree that they
should be permitted to lead evidence by way of affidavits.
Let the affidavits on behalf of the plaintiff be filed within
three months.
Courter-affidavit within two months
thereafter. List the suit for further proceedings on 16th
March, 1994."
9.

The plaintiff has filed several affidavits pursuant to the liberty

granted in the above order. Thereafter the parties were attempting to
arrive at a mutually acceptable compromise.
CS(OS) No. 1824/1992

This is clear from
Page No. 5 of 12

several orders made between 2005 and 2007. On 06.12.2007 also this
Court recorded that the parties were negotiating for a compromise.
This Court after considering the submissions had directed the
presence of the Managing Director of the first defendant: that order
was later suspended and the General Manager (Accounts) was
required to be present in Court.

Pursuant to that order, dated

29.01.2008, the defendant has filed an application along with certain
calculations.
10.

Learned counsel for the defendant relied on the calculations

submitted in Court. He states that the proposal was made on the basis
of a one time settlement formula which existed in 2005.

That

proposal acknowledged the payment of Rs.18,13,065/- by the plaintiff
shown as received, the balance sum due from the plaintiff on account
of the one time settlement formula by the Board of DFC is disclosed at
Rs.17,79,203.99.

This includes 13.5%

compound interest (in

accordance with the scheme) till the date the advance was declared as
a doubtful non performing asset.

The DFC claims to have added a

simple interest from 01.08.1991 to 09.03.1992.
11.

The plaintiff, on the other hand, urged that as the unit could not

become operational due to the sealing and issuance of show cause
notice on three occasions, which had an adverse impact on its viability
and the lack of credit and working capital from the Punjab National

CS(OS) No. 1824/1992

Page No. 6 of 12

Bank as well as the fact that the sum of Rs.12.61 lacs was not
available for the period of

14 months, the defendants cannot now

seek to make a premium from their wrongs. It is submitted that in
order to repay the dues the unit and the machinery was sold after
seeking permission of the Court, a fact recorded in the present
proceeding. In these circumstances, the plaintiff submitted that he is
willing to settle the entire dispute by paying Rs.12 lacs.
12.

Learned counsel for the defendant submitted that the one time

settlement scheme was in vague in 2005 and applicable to the
defendant till 30.11.2005; this fact was within the knowledge of the
plaintiff.

However, the offer of settling the entire dispute was for

paying Rs. 17.7 lacs which was not availed. Learned counsel placed
reliance on the extract of the account and submitted that due credit
was given to all the payments made by the plaintiff and necessary
interest, which had to be duly reflected in the books. According to the
account, a sum of Rs.17,42,588.32 has been shown as received
towards principal and Rs.5,40,476.68 has been shown as adjusted
towards the interest.
13.

Counsel submitted that in terms of the agreement the plaintiff

was duty bound to repay amounts in accordance with the schedule
prescribed. The DFC could not be faulted although it released a sum
in excess of Rs.22 lakhs by the stipulated period on 19.08.1988. In

CS(OS) No. 1824/1992

Page No. 7 of 12

these circumstances, there was nothing arbitrary in the action taken.
Counsel submitted on instruction that although one time settlement
offer was closed on 13.11.2005, having regard to the over all
conspectus of facts, this Court may take an appropriate decision as to
the final order to be made since the issue pertains to the rate of
interest to be paid during the pendency of the proceedings.
14.

It is evident from the above narration of facts and discussion

that the parties agreed to the terms whereby a sum of Rs.33 lacs was
payable to the plaintiff. It is not in dispute that of the entire sum of
Rs.33 lacs for which the repayment schedule was made only 6
installments were disbursed.

The total sum actually disbursed i.e.

Rs.22,80,000/- was paid to the plaintiff in the following terms:(1)

11.08.1987

-

1,94,000/-

(2)

(6)
15.

29.07.1987 -

01.08.1988 -

80,000/-

It has not been disputed that the sum of Rs.12,61,400/- was not

made available by the DFC to the plaintiff. That was deposited with
the

Punjab National Bank which apparently made the amount

available to the plaintiff after 14 months from the date of its being
CS(OS) No. 1824/1992

Page No. 8 of 12

kept in its account i.e. 26.08.1987. There is nothing in the Mortgage
Deed indicating that the amount would not be made available to the
plaintiff but could be disbursed to the bank , to be released later. In
the circumstances, what emerges is that at the relevant time ,i.e., till
August 1988 or so the plaintiff was, in fact, able to secure only a sum
of Rs.10 lacs. However, in terms of the obligations cast upon him in
the Mortgage Deed the repayment schedule became operative and
also the interest has started ticking as agreed by the parties i.e.
17.5% compoundable with quarterly installment rests.

If one takes

into account the further circumstance that the plaintiffs' unit was
sealed admittedly on three occasions before the suit was filed, his
plight is understandable.
16.

As noticed earlier,

the plaintiff sold the unit and repaid the

entire amount. Therefore, the narrow question which this court has
to deal with in the present case is the rate of interest and the amount
to be paid to the defendant. The defendant, no doubt, had indicated
at one stage that if the plaintiff was willing to accept a one time
settlement, it would settle the entire dispute for Rs.17.79 lacs. That
offer apparently existed only upto 30.11.2005. The plaintiff, on the
other hand, was willing to accept the offer but wanted to pay only
Rs.12 lacs.
17.

Now it is clear that at one stage the defendant was willing to

CS(OS) No. 1824/1992

Page No. 9 of 12

settle the dispute, the plaintiff too wanted to settle it.

The only

difference between the two was to the extent of Rs.5,57 lacs. On the
account submitted by the defendant in support of the application (i.e.
I.A. No. 1741/2008) the details of the principal and interest accruing
on the advance has been disclosed. According to this statement, the
total amount repaid by the plaintiff works out to Rs.22,83,065/-. This
has been submitted by the defendant in the following manner:(1)

- Rs.17,2,588.32

(2)
18.

Principal
Interest

- Rs.5,40,476.68

The parties are agreed that lump sum amounts were deposited

by the plaintiff. The defendant cannot be entirely blamed in splitting
the amount received and reflecting part of them towards interests yet
in the peculiar circumstance of this case such accrual in the opinion of
the Court resulted in prejudice of the plaintiff.

The plaintiff had

requested for postponement of the repayment schedule and said that
it should commence from 1989.

as

This figure varies with the figure mentioned in the

detailed statement which is Rs.22,83,065/-.

Therefore, the matter

can be resolved by giving due credit to the repayment made as if the
same were adjusted against the principal amount. In view of these

CS(OS) No. 1824/1992

Page No. 10 of 12

circumstances and peculiar facts, the Court, while not commenting
on the calculations, is of the opinion that to suitably reduce the
liability of the plaintiff, the defendant cannot be compelled to accept
Rs.12 lacs which is now being offered. In the circumstances, having
regard to the above factors, the plaintiff should be granted relief upon
paying the sum of Rs.14.5 lakhs. The defendant in my opinion should
accept the same and reflect that the liabilities of the plaintiff are
closed.
20.

In view of the above discussion, the suit is decreed in the

following terms :(1)

The plaintiff shall pay to defendant No.1 a sum of Rs.14.5 lakhs

in full and final settlement of the disputes which are subject matters
of this suit within a period of three months. In such event, the amount
so paid shall be deemed to be in full settlement of the defendant's
entitlement, and are declared to be so.
(2)

In case, the plaintiff defaults in paying amounts as indicated in

direction (1) above, the defendants are free to take action in
accordance with law and enforce their rights under the Mortgage
Deed, for recovery of the above amount, with interest at 12% per
annum.

CS(OS) No. 1824/1992

(3)

The defendant shall upon receipt of the amounts as directed by

this Court, release the title deeds in accordance with law and other
terms of the mortgaged deed lying with it to the plaintiff.
The suit is decreed in the above terms.
