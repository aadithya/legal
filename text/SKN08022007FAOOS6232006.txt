1.

Mr. K.D. Shivdasani, expired on 10th May, 1991. His wife

daughters of Late Mr. K.D. Shivdasani. Respondent No. 1, Ms.

FAO (OS) No. 623/2006

Geeta Gidwani,

Page 2

has filed a suit

for partition and perpetual

injunction against the appellant-Ms. Sunita Shivdasani and
respondent No. 2-Ms. Pooja Gangaramani in respect of
movable and immovable properties left behind by late Mr. K.D.
Shivdasani.
2.

The appellant in her written statement has propounded an

oral Will in her favour by late Mr. K.D. Shivadasani and has
claimed that Mr. Gopal Deumal Shivdasani, elder brother of Mr.
K.D. Shivadasani, has informed her about the said oral Will.
3.

By the impugned order dated 22nd May, 2006, learned

single Judge has held that under the Indian Succession Act,
1925 (hereinafter referred to as the Act for short), there can be
Privileged and Unprivileged Wills. Unprivileged Wills must be in
writing and should also comply with the requirements of Section
63 of the Act.

Privileged Wills can be made by a soldier

employed in an expedition or engaged in actual warfare or
mariner being at sea. Privileged Will are oral but requirements
of Section 66 of the Act must be complied with including
presence of two witnesses at the time when the oral Will is
made and a Will made by word of mouth is null at the expiry of
one month, if the testator is alive. Ld. Single Judge has held that

FAO (OS) No. 623/2006

Page 3

late Mr. K.D. Shivadasani could not have made a privileged will.
4.

Learned counsel for the appellant had submitted that oral

Wills by ordinary persons have been recognised and accepted
and in support of his contention had relied upon the following
decisions:(i)

Mt. Izhar Fatma Bibi and others versus Mt. Ansar

Fatma Bibi and others, AIR 1939 Allahabad 348.
(ii)

Mahabir Prasad and Another versus Syed Mustafa

Husain and Others, AIR 1937 Privy Council 174.
(iii)

Venkat Rao and another versus Namdeo and others,

AIR 1931 Privy Council 285
(iv) Ganesh Prasad versus Lala Hazari Lal and others,
AIR (29) 1942 Allahabad 201
(v)

Ramchandra versus Anasuyabai AIR 1969 Mysore

64 and
(vi) Shanti Lal versus Mohal Lal, AIR 1986 J & K 61.
5.

Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand,

had referred to Sections 63, 65 and 66 of the Act.
6.

It is correct that the Act was enacted to consolidate law

applicable to intestate and testamentary succession. The Act
consolidated and repealed nine different Acts including Hindu

FAO (OS) No. 623/2006

Page 4

Wills Act, 1870 but this by itself is not the determining factor.
7. Under the customary law, a Hindu could make a Will in
writing and also orally i.e. a nuncupative Will. However,
with the enactments of the Hindu Wills Act, 1870, Hindus
were required to make Wills or codicils in writing and the
same were also required to be signed and attested.
However, the said Act was applicable only on Wills or
codicils made or executed on or after 1st September, 1870
within specified territories and to Wills and codicils outside
those territories in so far as they related to immovable
properties situated within the specified territories.
8.

With the repeal of Hindu Wills Act, 1870 by passing of
the Act in question, the existing mandatory provisions that
a Hindu must make a written Will were re-enacted in
clauses (a) and (b) of Section 57 of the Act. Sub-Clause
(c) to Section 57 was added by Act 18 of 1929. The effect
of sub-Clause (c) is that it makes provisions of Part VI, as
set out in Schedule III of the Act, applicable to all Wills
made by Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs and Jainas on or after
1st January, 1927. Section 57 of the Act, for the sake of
convenience is reproduced below:-

FAO (OS) No. 623/2006

Page 5

“Application of certain provisions of part
to a class of wills made by Hindus etc.The provisions of this part which are set
out in Sch III shall, subject to the
restrictions and modifications specified
therein, apply-”
(a) to all wills and codicils made by any
Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina on or after
the first day of September 1870 within the
territories which at the said date were
allowed .... to the Lieutenant Governor of
Bengal or within the local limits of the
ordinary original civil jurisdiction of the
High Courts of judicature at Madras and
Bombay; and
(b) to all such wills and codicils made
outside those territories and limits so far as
relates to immovable property situate
within those territories or limits; and
(c) to all wills and codicils made by any
Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh or Jaina, on or after
the first day of January 1927, to which
those provisions are not applied, by cll (a)
and (b).
Provided that marriage shall not revoke
any such will or codicil.”
9. With the enactment of Clause (c) all Wills and Codicils
made by any Hindu on or after 1st January, 1927 must
comply with sections of Part VI specified in Schedule III of
the Act. Part VI of the Act comprises of Sections 57 to 191.

FAO (OS) No. 623/2006

Page 6

However, only Sections specified in Schedule III of the Act
have been made applicable to Wills made by a Hindu.
Sections which are not specified in Schedule III are not
applicable to Wills made by a Hindu.
10.Schedule III of the Act is as under:“PROVISIONS

and the word 'grand-children' shall be
deemed to include children, whether
adopted or natural-born of a child
whether adopted or natural-born; and
the expression 'daughter-in-law' shall
be deemed to include the wife of an
adopted son.”
11. Section 57 read with Schedule III makes Sections 63 of
the Act applicable to all Hindus. Section 63 of the Act
relates to execution of unprivileged Wills and reads as
under:“Execution of unprivileged wills.- Every
testator, not being a soldier employed in
an expedition or engaged in actual
warfare, or an airman so employed or
engaged, or a mariner at sea, shall
executed his will according to the following
rules:

FAO (OS) No. 623/2006

Page 8

(a) The testator shall sign or shall
affix his marks to the
will, or it shall
be signed by some other person in his
presence and by his direction.
(B) The signature or mark of the
testator, or the signature of the person
signing for him, shall be so placed that it
shall appear that it was intended thereby
to give effect to the writing as a will.
(c) The will shall be attested by two
or more witnesses, each of whom has
seen the testator sign or affix his mark to
the will or has seen some other person
sign the will, in the presence and by the
direction of the testator or has received
from
the
testator
a
personal
acknowledgment of his signature or mark,
or of the signature of such other person;
and such of the witnesses shall sign the
will in the presence of the testator, but it
shall not be necessary that more than one
witness be present at the same time, and
no particular form of attestation shall be
necessary.”
12.In view of Section 57 read with Schedule III of the Act,
requirements of Section 63 must be complied with and are
mandatory for a Will executed by a Hindu. A Will which
does not comply with the requirement of Section 63 of the
Act is null and void. Clause (a) to Section 63 requires a
Will should be in writing because it is to be signed or
marked by the testator himself or signed by some other
person in the presence of the Testator or on his direction.

FAO (OS) No. 623/2006

Page 9

A Will, as per Section 63, is also required to be attested by
two or more witnesses. Thus section 63 of the Act requires
a Will to be in writing.
13.

Section 65 of the Act relates to execution of privileged

Wills or oral Wills. Section 65 has not been included in
Schedule III and in view of Sections 57 of the Act, the
same is therefore not applicable to Hindus. It, therefore,
follows that Hindus cannot make a privileged Will after 1 st
January, 1927 even if conditions of Section 65 are
satisfied. Section 66 of the Act will obviously have no
application to Hindus as the said Section relates to mode
of execution of an oral or a privileged Will and other
conditions for a valid oral will.
14. Judgment of the Allahabad High Court in the case of Mt.
Ishar Fatima Bibi (supra) is a case of a mohammedan and
therefore has no application. Similarly, in the case of
Mahabir Prasad (supra), Privy Council was considering the
alleged

oral

Will

made

by

a

mohammedan.

Mohammedans are still competent to make oral Wills.
Section 57 is not applicable to mohammedans. Judgment
of the Privy Council in the case of Venkat Rao (supra)
relates to oral disposition by one Mr. Vishram Patil who
expired on 23rd December, 1919 and was a resident of
Central Provinces. The said decision obviously has no

FAO (OS) No. 623/2006

Page 10

application as provisions of Section 57 of the Act were not
applicable and the provisions of Section 2 of the Hindu
Wills Act, 1870 were also not applicable as the deceased
was not living in the specified area.

Hindus too could

make oral Wills prior to Hindu Wills Act, 1870 and
thereafter in those territories where the Act was not
applicable subject to the condition that a Will in writing was
required in case of immovable properties located within
the specified area. Full Bench of Allahabad High Court in
Ganesh Prasad case(supra) examined the question
whether on death of a Hindu his self acquired property
would devolve on his undivided sons to the exclusion of
the divided son under the Mitakshara Law. The oral Will
relied upon was of 1926 (see page 218 in the All India
Reporter). In Ramachandra's case (supra) oral Will by one
Krishnaji was propounded on the basis of a document
executed by his widow in 1904. These cases relied upon
by the appellant do not relate to oral Wills made by Hindus
after 1st January,1927. It is quite clear that there is no
scope for a Hindu to make an oral or a nuncupative Will
after the said date. Judgment

of Jammu and Kashmir

High Court in the case of Shanti Lal (supra) did not
specifically examine this issue and question including
Section 57 of the Act. The provisions of the Act have not
been considered and dealt with. The question whether a
Hindu can execute an oral Will after enactment and
enforcement of the Act, was not in question in the said
decision. A decision is a binding precedence for what it

FAO (OS) No. 623/2006

Page 11

states and not for what can be inferred and presumed to
have been decided. (Refer Punjab National Bank Versus
R.L. Vaid

reported in 2002 (4) SCC 638), and A-One

Granites versus State of UP reported in 2001 (3) SCC
537.)
15. The Appeal and the application are accordingly
dismissed. The appellant will also pay cost of Rs.5,000/to the Delhi High Court Bar Association Library Fund.
Costs will be deposited within four weeks from today.
