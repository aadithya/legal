V.B. GUPTA, J.

The present appeal is filed by the Revenue against the order dated
24th February, 2006 passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi
Bench “SMC” in ITA No.3869(Del)/2005 for the assessment year 1980-81.

The brief facts are that the original assessment in this case was

completed on 28th February, 1983 at a loss of Rs.87,351/-. On receipt of
information from ADI, Bombay, a notice under Section 148 of the Income
Tax Act (for short 'Act') was issued to the Assessee in March, 1985. The
Assessee did not file any return. Accordingly, Assessing Officer issued
notice under Section 142(1) of the Act and the reassessment was done by
making addition of Rs.3,10,000/- on account of cash credits appearing in the
books which is as follows:(i) Shri Prakash V.Thakkar
(ii) Ambica Corporation
(iii) Sh.K.D.Khona

3.

Rs.1,50,000/Rs.1,00,000/Rs. 60,000/---------------Rs.3,10,000/---------------The reason stated for addition was that Sh.N.J.Rawal, a hundi broker,

through whom these amounts have been received, indulged in 'Hawala'
transaction. These persons were not produced to support the fact of making
advance to the Assessee.

The issue of reopening the assessment and

addition travelled upto Income Tax Appellate Tribunal and the Division
Bench of the Tribunal in ITA No.2017/Del/1990 decided on 24th April, 1994
upheld the action to initiate re-assessment proceedings. On merits, the
Tribunal set aside the assessment to be framed afresh in accordance with
law.

The Assessing Officer again made the same additions and the Income

Tax Appellate Tribunal again by its order dated 13 th August, 2003, set aside
the assessment and directed the Assessing Officer that he shall complete the
assessment in accordance with the order of the Tribunal dated 24th August,
1994.
5.

Consequent to this, a notice under Section 142(1) of the Act was

issued to the Assessee to establish the genuineness of the credits and
accordingly, Assessing Officer again made the addition as unexplained
loans for Rs.3,10,000/- and assessment stood completed at an income of
Rs.2,22,650/-.
6.

The Assessee filed appeal before Commissioner Income Tax(A) who

upheld the addition for the reason that Assessing Officer could make
enquiry in such an old case only if the Appellant provided information
about the parties and brought material about genuineness of the credits.
7.

The learned Tribunal vide impugned order did not find any

justification in sustaining the addition and accordingly, decided the matter
in favour of the Assessee.
8.

It has been contended by the learned counsel for the Appellant that

the order of Income Tax Appellant Tribunal is contrary to the facts and law
since the Assessing Officer had specifically carried out the enquiry and in
ITA No.1500/2006

Page 3 of 6

spite of various opportunities, the Assessee could not establish the identity,
genuineness or creditworthiness of the creditors and further the staleness of
claim does not make a wrong as right.
9.

It is clear from the records that the Assessing Officer did not carry

out the directions given by the Tribunal for making assessment in the case.
In the original assessment, the Assessee had established the credits and the
Assessing Officer being satisfied, did not make any addition thereof. The
Assessee did not know any of the creditors personally and the information
on the basis of which action for reassessment was taken was based on the
statement given by Sh.N.J.Rawal, hundi broker and as such he was the right
person from whom the enquiries should have been made by the Assessing
Officer. Admittedly, this was not done in this case and, therefore, the
Assessing Officer should not have rested whole enquiry only on the
information from the Assessee.

10.

Under the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, since the loans

was not taken directly by the Assessee, the helplessness shown by him to
produce these parties or tell their present whereabouts could not be termed
as non-cooperation, particularly, when the matter was more than 20 years
old. Any remissness on the part of the Assessing Officer has to be at the
cost of national exchequer and must necessarily result in the loss of
revenue.
11.

On this point, a reference be made to the case of Parshuram Pottery

Works Co.Ltd. vs. ITO, 106 ITR 1(SC); the relevant portion of which reads
as under:“It has been said that the taxes are the price that we
pay for civilization. If so, it is essential that those
who are entrusted with the task of calculating and
realizing that price should familiarize themselves
with the relevant provisions and become well-versed
with the law on the subject. Any remissness on their
part can only be at the cost of the national exchequer
and must necessarily result in loss of revenue. At the
same time, we have to bear in mind that the policy of
law is that there must be a point of finality in all legal
proceedings, that stale issues should not be
reactivated beyond a particular stage and that lapse
of time must induce repose in spheres of human
activities. So far as the income tax assessment orders
are concerned, they cannot be reopened on the score
of income escaping assessment under Section 147 of
the Act of 1961 after the expiry of four years from the
end of assessment year unless there be omission order
failure on the part of the assessee to disclose fully
and truly all material facts necessary for the
ITA No.1500/2006

assessment. As already mentioned, this cannot be
said in the present case. The appeal is consequently
allowed, the judgment of the High Court is set aside
and the impugned notices are quashed. The parties in
the circumstances shall bear their own costs
throughout.”
The above being the position, no fault can be found with the view

taken by the Tribunal. Thus, the order of Tribunal does not give rise to a
question of law, much less a substantial question of law, to fall within the
limited purview of Section 260-A of the Income Tax Act, which is confined
to entertaining only such appeals against the order which involves a
substantial question of law.
13.

Accordingly, the present appeal is, hereby, dismissed.
