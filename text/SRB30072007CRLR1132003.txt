2.

The brief facts necessary to decide present case are that Sh. Rakesh Pahwa

(hereafter A-1) was employed as the clerk cum cashier and Sh. Rakesh Bist,
Clerk,(hereafter Respondent -1) in the Oriental Bank of commerce(OBC),
Wazirpur, Delhi. It was alleged that both cheated the bank to the tune of Rs.24.75
Lakhs. During investigation, allegedly the role of Sh. Sanjeev Pahwa, brother of
A-1 and Smt. Sushma Pahwa (Respondent no.2) wife of Sh. Rakesh Pahwa came
to light. The allegation of Cheating the bank was mainly against the accused
Rakesh Pahwa. The allegations regarding the others were that they entered into
criminal conspiracy with him, and cheated the bank.
3.

A-1 was posted in OBC since 1983 and from the year 1988 to 1991, he

performed duties on the teller seat in the branch. From 1991 onwards, till midMay 1994, he worked on book writing and posting in general ledger etc. He also
did the job of bringing the inward clearing from the service branch. The
Respondent no 1 performed the job

of bringing the inward clearing from the

service branch during that period. They allegedly committed fraud by using the
various SB/CA accounts being maintained at the branch and also with some other
accounts of different banks.

A-1 and Respondent -1 used to write the schedule

jointly and either of them used to go to the service branch for collecting the inward
clearings.
4.

SB A/c No.3605 was allegedly opened on 22.3.87 jointly by the accused

Crl. Rev. Pet. No. 113 of 2003

2 of 8

and his wife Smt. Sushma Pahwa at Punjab National Bank (PNB) Pitampura
branch. The account opening form was signed by both and the specimen signatures
card also bore their signatures. Smt. Sushma Pahwa was then working with the
PNB. A sum of Rs.50, 000/- was credited in that account and A-1 maintained it.
On 17.7.92 a sum of Rs.50, 000/- was allegedly withdrawn by Smt. Sushma.
5.

The Respondent no.1, Rakesh Bist allegedly maintained SB a/c no. 13256

with the OBC in the name of Rakesh Bist, Dinesh and Usha Bist. He used two
cheques bearing no.220893 and 22894 dated 5.2.94 for 18,000/- favouring ANZ
Grindlays Bank IFCI equity shares issued in SB a/c no.4577 out of the cheque
book against SB a/c 11111 of A-1 and his wife. It was also alleged that on
24.4.93, the inward clearing was brought by him and while recording the return
cheques in the clearing schedule he deliberately omitted mentioning the return
cheque as Rs. 10,000/- relating to SB a/c no.7576 of the accused and his brother.
The entry of the return

cheque appeared on the upper copy of the clearing

schedule but its impression was missing in the lower copy.
6.

It is further alleged that a fictitious entry of Rs. 52,500/-was recorded in the

day book of credit side against SB ledger no.43 and corresponding depot entry in
the SB a/c No.13256 of Respondent no.1 and against 15 cheques bearing
no.248101 to 248115 of Rs.3500 each following IFCI equating issue were

Crl. Rev. Pet. No. 113 of 2003

3 of 8

presented by SBI Darya Ganj. All the instruments were missing from the record
but the cheque book issue register showed that cheque nos.248101 to 248115 were
out of the cheque book issued to, and collected by A-1.
7.

Learned counsel for CBI argued that Rakesh Bist, Respondent no.1 used to

assist A-1 on the day book seat. They would write the schedule jointly and either
of them would go to the service branch for collecting inward and outward
collection of cheques. The Learned counsel urged that without the active
connivance of the 1st Respondent A-1 could not have achieved his motive. The
counsel also contended that A-1 and Rakesh Bist processed the record relating to
saving band account maintained by them with Oriental Bank of Commerce,
Wazirpur Branch.
8.

The learned counsel further contended that Smt.Sushma Pahwa was

maintaining SB A/c no. 3605 at Punjab National bank, Pitampura. She is a joint
account holder with her husband at the Oriental bank of Commerce, Wazirpur. The
account No. is 11111. On 15.7.92 a sum of Rs.50,000/-was fraudulently credited in
SB account No.3605, which was withdrawn by her on 17.7.92 and thus she was
fully aware of her husband’s ill intentions.
9.

The Learned Counsel further argued that Rakesh Bist prepared schedule

dated 24.4.93 mentioning return of cheque of the sum of Rs.10,000/- in the SB A/c

Crl. Rev. Pet. No. 113 of 2003

4 of 8

No.7576 of the accused but that entry was not reflected in the carbon copy of the
schedule. Thus he facilitated a wrongful gain of Rs.10,000/- to A-1. Counsel
urged that making of false clearing schedule and receipt of two cheques of
Rs.1800/- each by Respondent no.1 from the account of the accused established
the involvement of the Respondent no.1. He also submitted that immediately after
a fraudulent credit of Rs.50,000/- on 15.7.92 in the joint account of A-1 and his
wife, she withdrew the said amount. It was urged that the Court erred as much as
it weighed and considered the impact of the evidence, as if it were conducting a
trial.
10.

The trial court by its order dated 2.11.2002 discharged the Respondent no.1

and 2. The court held that the element of criminal conspiracy vis-à-vis them was
absent and further there was no cogent and sufficient evidence against them. The
court was constrained to discharge the first respondent because of the following
reasons:
i)

withdrawal slips of Wazirpur Branch of all the accounts by which the

defrauded amounts had been withdrawn and all the documents/entries made in the
Ledger, Day-book, long-book, etc., are in the hand writing of accused Rakesh
Pahwa and not in the hand of accused No.2 Rakesh Bist.
ii)

Rakesh Pahwa was at liberty to use any of the cheque book leaves for any

Crl. Rev. Pet. No. 113 of 2003

5 of 8

of the accounts maintained by him at the Branch.
iii)

the fictitious entry of Rs.52,500/- recorded in the Day-book on credit side

against SB ledger No.43 and corresponding debit-entry in SB ledger No. 38 in
transfer column on 19.12.93 and credited in SB a/c No.13256 of Accused No.2
Rakesh Bist against which entries of 15 cheques bearing No. 248101 of Rs.3500/each presented by SBI, Daryaganj, Delhi for clearing were not passed by him;
iv)

The case of the prosecution that all the cheques were found missing from

the record but the cheque-book issue register showed that the cheuqe book out of
which cheque No.248101 to 248115 were issued and collected by accused Rakesh
Pahwa. Here too, the involvement of Rakesh Bist was not indicated.
11.

As regards Sushma Pahwa, the court was of the opinion that the only

material put forward against her was D-271, which indicated that the amount of
Rs. 50,000/- was withdrawn on 17-7-1992, and not the same day it was put into the
account, apparently at the bidding of her husband. The court noticed that the
account was maintained jointly with A-1, as also in the case of another account in
Wazirpur branch. The solitary instance, in the absence of any other transaction or
act, was insufficient to indicate commission of any offence or complicity in its
commission, warranting a charge under Section 120-B, IPC.
12.

It is trite law that conspiracy is seldom established by direct evidence; it is

Crl. Rev. Pet. No. 113 of 2003

6 of 8

hatched in stealth. Oftentimes, it involves series of acts by diverse acts of persons;
in many cases, one set of actors may well be unaware about the role, or existence
of others. Yet, that does not lower the threshold for the prosecution, which still has
to rely on solid foundation, even while surmising about a kind of behaviour, or
pattern. The threshold still remains, "grave suspicion" that the accused were
involved in the commission of the offence. It is not mere suspicion, or reasonable
suspicion arising from such surmises (State of Maharastra -vs- Sukhdeo Singh
1992 (3) SCC 700; P. K. Narayanan v. State of Kerala 1995 (1) SCC 142 ). Judged
from this yardstick, the court was justified in proceeding, as it did, as regards both
the respondents. Though A-1 and the second respondent were colleagues, the vital
documents showed involvement of A-1 alone; he had also manipulated the
situation to get the cheque withdrawal slips/ cheque books; the entries in question,
in the concerned books of the bank were in his handwriting. The involvement of
Rakesh Bist was only sketchy; it cannot be termed as one resulting in "grave
suspicion". So far as Sushma Pahwa was concerned, the solitary instance of her
signature on one cheque signifies nothing. There cannot be any automatic
presumption that being the wife of A-1, she was aware of all his activities, or was
party to them.
13.

Having given my anxious consideration to the submissions on behalf of the

CBI, and also after examining the reasoning of the trial court, as well as the
Crl. Rev. Pet. No. 113 of 2003

7 of 8

materials, I am of the opinion that the view taken by the Special Judge does not
call for interference. It neither acted in material irregularity, nor did it overlook any
material evidence, or err in law, in discharging the respondents. Resultantly, the
revision has to fail; it is dismissed. In the circumstances, there shall be no order on
costs.
