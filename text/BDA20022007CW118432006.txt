1.

In this petition, the petitioner No.1 is the mother of the petitioner No.2.

The petitioner No.1 is a retired Government servant. The petitioner No.2 is
currently a Government servant and is serving as a senior officer in the Indian
Police Service. The question involved in the present petition is with regard to the
reimbursement of medical expenditure incurred on account of the medical treatment
provided to the petitioner No.1.

2.

The petitioner No.1 underwent surgical intervention at the Nephrology

Department of Batra Hospital during 25.5.2005 to 18.8.2005. At that point of time,
the petitioner No.1 was a retired public servant having been an employee of the
Central Government till 31.10.1985. The petitioner No.1 did not have a CGHS card
in her own name but her name was included in petitioner No. 2's card as a
dependent.
3.

The petitioner No.2 submitted the claim for the medical treatment

provided to the petitioner No.1 as indicated above. The claim was allowed in part.
The total amount allegedly spent on the treatment was Rs.14,22,820/- but only a
sum of Rs.10,06,666/- was reimbursed to the petitioner No.2. Subsequently, some
objections were raised on account of the petitioner No.1 being a pensioner and
receiving the benefits in excess of Rs.1500/- per month and yet being shown as a
dependent.

It was objected that she was not entitled to reimbursement as a

dependent of her son (petitioner No.2). As a result of this objection, the petitioner
No.2 returned the entire amount i.e., Rs 10,06,666/- to the respondent without
prejudice to the claim of the petitioners. Thereafter, the petitioner No.1, on
20.03.2006,

was issued a CGHS Card bearing No. 86433 in her own name.

Having got the CGHS Card, the petitioner No.1 applied for reimbursement of the
entire amount of Rs.14,22,820/-. That application was rejected by a letter dated
26.06.2006 issued by the CMO, CGHS on the ground that the treatment period was

WP(C)11843/2006

Page No.2 of 7

25.5.2005 to 18.8.2005 whereas the CGHS token card was issued much later on
20.03.2006 i.e., after the treatment. Accordingly, the medical reimbursement claim
was held to be not reimbursable as per the CGHS Rules.
4.

Being aggrieved by this rejection, the present petition has been filed.

The prayers in the present petition so much as are relevant are as under:“a. Issue a Writ of Mandamus and/or an appropriate Writ, order or
direction in the nature of Mandamus, directing the Respondents
to reimburse petitioner No.2, the expense incurred by him for
the medical treatment of petitioner No.1, under the CGHS card
bearing no. 562928 issued in the name of petitioner No.2,
within such time as may be fixed by this Hon'ble Court;
b.

Strictly in the alternative in the unlikely event that prayer (a) is
not granted in favour of the petitioner then, Issue a Writ of
Certiorari and/or an appropriate Writ, order or direction in the
nature of Certiorari quashing the letter dated 22nd June 2006
(Annexure I) issued by respondent No.3 refusing to refund the
expenses incurred for the treatment of petitioner No.1; and
Issue a Writ of Mandamus and/or an appropriate writ, order or
direction in the nature of Mandamus, directing the Respondents
to reimburse to petitioner No.1, the expenses incurred for her
medical treatment, under the CGHS card bearing No. 86433
issued in the name of petitioner No.1, within such time as may
be fixed by this Hon'ble Court;

c.

Declare that, that part of Clause 12 of CGHS Guidelines which
requires a Government Servant to give a certificate that the
income of the parent, who is mainly dependent on him and
residing with him, does not exceed Rs.1,500/- per month; and is
inconsistent with and seeks to limit the benefit given by Clause
1 of the said Guidelines is violative of Article 21 of the
Constitution of India and therefore unconstitutional;

WP(C)11843/2006

Page No.3 of 7

d.
5.

Writ of Certiorari and/or an appropriate Writ, order or direction
in the nature of Certiorari quashing that part of Clause 12 of the
CGHS guidelines, which is unconstitutional.”
It was contended on behalf of the learned counsel for the petitioners

that insofar as the prayers `c' and `d' are concerned, he would not be pressing for the
same in the present writ petition and would like to reserve his right to raise the
issue, should the need arise, later. Insofar as the prayer `a' is concerned, it requires
the court to issue a direction to the respondent to reimburse the petitioner No.2 for
the medical expenses incurred on the treatment of the petitioner No.1 under the
CGHS card bearing No.562928 issued in the name of the petitioner No.2. Insofar
as this prayer is concerned, the learned counsel for the petitioners submits that he
would not be pressing this prayer at this stage and he may not be required to press
the prayer at all in case the alternative prayer is granted and the case of the
petitioner No.1 for reimbursement is disposed of by the authorities in a manner that
the amount of Rs.10,06,666/- is reimbursed to the petitioners. Therefore, it has
become imperative to examine the petitioners' alternative prayer as indicated in
prayer `b'. Insofar as this prayer is concerned, the question that arises is whether
the petitioner No.1 would have been denied the benefit under the scheme merely
because on the date on which she underwent medical treatment, she did not possess
a CGHS card / token. This issue is no longer a debatable issue insofar as this court
is concerned. It has been settled by various decisions including :S.K. Sharma v Union of India : 2002 (64) DRJ 620; and
WP(C)11843/2006

Page No.4 of 7

V.K. Jagdhari v Union of India & Ors : 2005 (85) DRJ 160
6.

In S.K. Sharma (supra) this court was confronted, inter alia, with the

question of reimbursement of expenses on the ground that the petitioner was not a
card holder of the CGHS. Other issues were also raised in that case. However,
what is relevant for the present case is that it was held in S.K. Sharma (supra) that
the material factor for the grant of benefit under the CGHS scheme is the status of a
person which was that of a retired pensioner and this was not governed by the fact
as to whether the petitioner was a card holder of the CGHS scheme or not.
7.

In V.K. Jagdhari (supra), a learned Single Judge of this court had

examined the entire legal position and summarized the position as emerging from a
discussion of the various decisions of this court. The said position was indicated in
paragraph 13 of the decision which, inter alia, recorded that it is the status of a
retired employee which leads to his entitlement and it is not governed by his status
as a card holder. It was also recorded that if medical treatment is availed, whether
the employee is a card holder or not is irrelevant and full reimbursement has to be
given. The decision of this court in B.R. Mehta v Union of India : 1999(50) DRJ
270 : 1999(79) DLT 388 was also referred to.
8.

In view of these decisions, this court, at the interim stage, passed an

order on 12.12.2006 requiring the respondent to reconsider the petitioners' claim
and issue an appropriate order within four weeks. The respondent was also directed

WP(C)11843/2006

Page No.5 of 7

to communicate the same to the petitioner directly. It appears that the matter was
reconsidered and an order was passed on 15.2.2007. A photo copy of which is
handed over by the learned counsel for the petitioner and the same is taken on
record. Mr Kait, who appears on behalf of the respondent (Union of India), submits
that such an order was passed. In my view, the order has, unfortunately, not
proceeded in the right direction.

The court, while passing the order dated

12.12.2006, had clearly indicated the view taken by this court consistently in
several decisions. Despite this, the order dated 15.2.2007, rejecting the claim of the
petitioners, continues evince the same ideology on the part of the respondent which
has been negated by this court on several occasions. This can be easily noted by
referring to the following portion of the order dated 15.2.2007:“Facilities under CGHS can be availed only from the date from
which a card is issued in favour of a person after payment of the
requisite charges. For any treatment/expenditure incurred before
the acquisition of a card. CGHS facilities cannot be availed and
post-facto-facility cannot be claimed under CGHS, without the
availability of the card.”
9.

This approach is clearly contrary to what has been held by this court

repeatedly and the consequent order passed on the basis of this requires to be set
aside. Accordingly, this writ petition is disposed of with the direction that the
impugned order dated 26.6.2006 as well as the order dated 15.2.2007 are set aside.
The respondent is directed to process the reimbursement claim of the petitioner
No.1 in accordance with the directions given above and the view taken by this court
WP(C)11843/2006

Page No.6 of 7

as also the CGHS scheme. This exercise is to be carried out within two weeks.
Insofar as the prayers a, c and d are concerned, the petitioners have not pressed the
same at this juncture and liberty is granted to the petitioners to agitate the same, if
need be, at an appropriate stage.
Dasti to both the parties.
