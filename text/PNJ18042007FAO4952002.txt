No.496/2002 & CM No.998/2002 in FAO. No.497/2002
There is a delay in filing the aforenoted appeals. Vide
above captioned applications it is prayed that delay in filing the
appeals be condoned.
In the interest of justice, delay is condoned.
FAOs. No. 495/2002, 496/2002 & 497/2002
1.

The above captioned three appeals arise out of the

same accident which took place on 3.8.1989 involving a three
wheeler scooter and a delivery van bearing no. DHL-8407.
2.

In the said road accident, 4 persons who were traveling

in the three wheeler scooter were injured. All 4 filed claim
petitions. 1 out of the 4 is satisfied with the award. 3 are
aggrieved.

Page 2 of 12

3.

After holding driver of the van guilty of rash and

negligent driving, learned Tribunal awarded a compensation of
Rs.64,000/- to M.Shashi (Suit No.1831/2000), Rs.23,000/- to Smt.
Irene (Suit No.1829/2000), Rs.10,000/- to Ms. Valsala (Suit
No.1830/2000).

6.

In

FAO

495/2002,

pertaining to compensation granted to Valsala.
7.

Before dealing with the compensation awarded to the

appellants, I note that all the 3 appellants have sought to place on
record medical certificates which were not produced before the
Tribunal by filing an application under Order XLI Rule 27 CPC (CM
No.995/2002 in FAO. No.495/2002, CM No.997/2002 in FAO.
No.496/2002 & CM No.999/2002 in FAO. No.497/2002).
8.

Date of accident is 3.2.1989. Award is dated 16.2.02.

The proceedings in Tribunal have continued for 13 long years. I
see no reason why medical certificates certifying the condition of
the appellant were not placed before the Tribunal.
Page 3 of 12

9.

Even otherwise the said certificates do not inspire

confidence.
10.

The medical certificate sought to be relied upon by

appellant, Irene is dated 20.6.2002 and is issued by Dr. Joji
Thomas, MDS, Cosmopolitan Hospital, Trivendrum.

The said

certificate records that appellant Irene is under continued medical
treatment of Dr. Joji Thomas.

Irene had suffered an injury

affecting front 4 teeth. The accident had occurred in year 1989. It
is highly improbable that appellant is undergoing treatment for a
period of 13 years for an injury of the kind suffered by her.
11.

Likewise, the other two certificates sought to be

produced by other two appellants are also not credit worthy and
cannot be relied upon.
12.

The medical certificate sought to be relied upon by

appellant, M. Shashi is dated 1.6.2002. and is issued by Dr.
Radhakrishan A., MBBS, Government Hospital, Parrassala, Kerela.
M. Shashi had suffered an injury affecting his back. The certificate
records that appellant, M. Shashi is under continued medical
treatment and is suffering from severe back ache, neck pain and
knee joint pain. The nature of injury suffered by the appellant is
not mentioned. The treatment which is being administered to the
Page 4 of 12

appellant is not mentioned. More so, I fail to understand how the
injury of back is causing pain in knee joint. The said certificate is
unyielding and undependable.
13.

The medical certificate sought to be relied upon by the

appellant, Valsala is dated 12.7.2002 and records that appellant
Valsala, is under continued medical treatment as she is suffering
from headache and blurring of vision. The name of the doctor who
has issued the certificate is not clear. Again, neither the nature of
the injury sustained by her nor treatment being administered to
her is mentioned. The said certificate is also untrustworthy.
14.

Dealing with compensation assessed to M.Shashi, I

note that he suffered fracture of superior pubic ramus and injuries
on the back at the spinal region.

No permanent disability was

suffered by him.
15.

Reverting to the claim petition and the award, it was

pleaded by M.Shashi that he was a three wheeler scooter driver
and was earning Rs.8,000/- per month at the time of the accident.
It was further pleaded by him that he had spent Rs.15,000/- on his
treatment and that on account of injury suffered by him he was
not able to attend to his work for a period of one year.
16.

A compensation in sum of Rs.64,000/- has been
Page 5 of 12

awarded by the learned Tribunal.
17.

Break up of the compensation is as follows:-

18.

“a) Treatment Expenses :
Rs.15,000/b)
Loss of income
:
Rs.24,000/c)
Pain and suffering
:
Rs.25,000/-”
In absence of any clear and cogent evidence, learned

Tribunal has taken income of the deceased as Rs.2,000/- per
month and on that basis awarded a sum of Rs.24,000/- for loss of
income of one year (Rs.2,000 x 12 = Rs.24,000/-).
19.

Minimum wages for skilled labourers in the year 1989

was Rs.1,000/- per month, whereas the Tribunal has taken
monthly income of the deceased as Rs.2,000/- per month.
Moreover, it is

difficult to believe that for a injury of a kind

suffered by appellant, he was incapacitated for a period of one
year. Therefore, compensation awarded under the head 'loss of
income' is already on a higher side.
20.

Learned counsel for the appellant has drawn support

from the judgment of the Madras High Court in the decision
reported as 2003 ACJ. 142 Imtiaz Ahamed Vs. G.Banumathi & Anr.
in support of his contention that compensation awarded to the
appellant M. Shashi is inadequate. In the said case, a boy aged 19
years sustained serious injuries in an accident which took place

Page 6 of 12

on 25.10.1996.

Due to the said road accident, he sustained

fracture in his left leg below knee resulting in shortening of leg by
2” as also a fracture near left side of hip due to which hip
movement was considerably reduced.

The urethra in urinary

bladder was cut to the extent of 2 cm due to which his entire
urology system was damaged. Considering the gravity of injuries
sustained by the injured, the Division Bench of Madras High Court
awarded a compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- for pain and suffering
and a sum of Rs.3,00,000/- for loss of future prospects and loss of
marital relationship.
21.

The aforenoted judgment is not applicable in the

instant case for the reason, injured in the aforenoted case had
sustained multiple injuries which were very serious in nature.
22.

Considering the extent of injury sustained by the

appellant and the fact that no permanent disability was suffered
by him, compensation of Rs.25,000/- awarded by the Tribunal
under the head 'pain and suffering' is adequate.
23.

I see no reason to interfere with the award made by

the Tribunal in Suit No.1831/2000.
24.

FAO No. 497/2002 is accordingly dismissed.

25.

Dealing with compensation assessed to Irene, I note
Page 7 of 12

that she suffered minor injuries on her face and dislocation of
front 4 teeth.
26.

After considering evidence on record, Tribunal has

assessed the following compensation:“1.
2.
3.
27.

Treatment expenses :
Special Diet
:
Pain and suffering
:

Rs.3,000/Rs.10,000/Rs.10,000/-”

No specific ground has been urged by the learned

counsel for the appellant.
28.

There is no evidence of any permanent disability

suffered by appellant, Irene.

Medical reimbursement is on the

basis of amount claimed by the appellant.
29.

Considering the kind of injury suffered by her, amount

of Rs.10,000/- awarded under the head 'special diet' is excessive.
30.

Learned counsel for the appellant has relied upon the

judgment of Madras in the decision reported as P.Murugaiyan Vs.
K.Ramachandran 2003 ACJ 563.

In the said case, injured had

suffered 140% disability (70% ortho, 40% neuro, 30% dental).
Considering the extent of disability suffered by the injured, the
Division Bench awarded to the injured a compensation in sum of
Rs.7,75,000/-.
31.

The aforenoted decision is not applicable in the instant
Page 8 of 12

case for the reason, on account of injuries (dislocation of front 4
teeth) sustained by her, she has not suffered a permanent
disability.
32.

At this juncture, I note a decision of this Court in

MAC.APP.No.186/2007 decided on 23.3.2007.

In said case,

injured had suffered loss of 4 teeth as also fracture of the bone of
the left leg.

Learned Tribunal had awarded a compensation of

Rs.25,000/- under the head 'pain and suffering'. In the appeal,
the award was upheld.
33.

Taking note of the decision in MAC.APP.No.186/2007

and considering the injury of the appellant, a sum of Rs.10,000/awarded by the Tribunal under the head 'pain and suffering' is
adequate.
34.

It has to be borne in mind that the compensation is not

expected to be a windfall for the victim.

The award in Suit

No.1829/2000 is just, fair and reasonable.
35.

FAO No.496/2002 is accordingly dismissed.

36.

Dealing with the compensation awarded to Ms. Valsala,

I note that she sustained an injury in her left eye.
37.

After assessing evidence on record, learned Tribunal

has awarded following compensation:Page 9 of 12

38.

“1. Treatment expenses :
Rs.5,000/2.
Pain and suffering
:
Rs.5,000/-”
No specific ground has been urged by the learned

counsel for the appellant.
39.

It was pleaded by the appellant Valsala that she has

suffered permanent impairment of eye sight in her left eye. Since
there was no evidence showing the permanent impairment
suffered by her, learned Tribunal refused to believe the same.
40.

Medical reimbursement is on the basis of amount

claimed by the appellant. Since there was no evidence to show
that she was undergoing continued medical treatment, no
compensation has been awarded by the learned Tribunal under
the head 'future treatment expenses'.
41.

Appellant Valsala has not been able to show as to

which part of her eye was permanently damaged in the accident.
42.

Learned counsel for the appellant has drawn support

from the judgment of the Division Bench of the High Court of
Allahabad in the decision reported as United India Insurance
Company Ltd. Vs. Pratap Singh & Ors. 2004 ACJ 906 in support of
his contention that the compensation awarded to the appellant,
Valsala is inadequate.
43.

In the aforenoted case,

insurance company had
Page 10 of 12

challenged the award of the Tribunal whereby a compensation of
Rs.2,75,560/- was awarded to the injured. Injured had suffered
serious

injuries

of

eyes,

forehead

and

head

resulting

in

disfigurement of his face causing permanent disability of 40%.
Further, despite prolonged treatment and a major operation,
injured could not recover and became mentally retarded with
disability of 100%. Noting the gravity of injuries suffered by the
injured, Division Bench held that compensation of Rs.2,75,560/- is
not excessive.
44.

In the aforenoted case, injuries sustained by the

injured were very serious in nature making him permanently
disabled for the rest of his life. While in the instant case, exact
injury suffered by the appellant is not clear. She has not been
able to prove that she had suffered permanent impairment of eye
sight in her left eye.
45.

The extent of injury suffered by the appellant, Valsala

can be gauged from the fact that she was admitted in AIIMS on
the date of accident and was discharged on very next day. There
is no evidence of any future hospitalization.
46.

In absence of any evidence showing the exact injury

suffered by the appellant, the compensation of Rs.5,000/Page 11 of 12

awarded by the Tribunal for 'pain and suffering' is reasonable.
47.

Statutory

provisions

clearly

indicate

that

the

compensation must be “just” and it cannot be a bonanza or a
source of profit. The award of the Tribunal in Suit No.1830/2000
is just, fair and reasonable.
48.

FAO No.495/2002 is accordingly dismissed.

49.

FAO

No.495/2002,

FAO

No.496/2002

&

FAO

No.497/2002 are dismissed.
50.

No costs.
