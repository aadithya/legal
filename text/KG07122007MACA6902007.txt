KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
*

In the present case the offending vehicle was duly
insured with respondent no.3 insurance company, therefore,
MAC APP No.690/2007

page 1 of 9

there is no need to serve respondents 1 & 2 who are the
driver and owner of the offending vehicle.

Service on

respondents 1 & 2 are dispensed with.
A short controversy is involved in the present
appeal. The appellants have claimed enhancement in the
compensation amount mainly on two grounds; i.e., the
Tribunal has not considered the

correct wages of the

deceased and also a meager amount of compensation has
been awarded under other heads of compensation. Both the
counsels appearing for the parties state that the matter can
be taken up for final disposal.
Admit.
Before adverting to deal with the contentions of
the parties, it would be appropriate to give brief facts of the
case as under:On 9.6.2005, deceased Babu Rao Gawai along with
other persons was travelling in TSR bearing registration
no.DL-1RC-3290 and going towards village Chhara, Distt.
Jhajjar, Haryana.
MAC APP No.690/2007

When the said TSR was going towards
page 2 of 9

Main Rohtak Road and reached near Joon Transport Office in
front of village Tikri Kalan, at about 2.40 p.m., a Tata 407
Tempo bearing registration no.HR-55-9979, came from
opposite direction by taking a wrong

side being driven in

rash and negligent manner, hit the said TSR, due to which all
the persons including the deceased received injuries. They
were taken to SGM Hospital, Mangol Puri, Delhi, where
deceased Babu Rao Gawai succumbed to injuries.
Counsel for the appellants contends that

the

deceased was earning a sum of Rs.10,000/- per month as he
was self employed as Raj Mistri. Counsel for the appellants
contends

that

the

Tribunal

has

wrongly

taken

into

consideration the minimum wages for assessing the income
of the deceased.
Rs.10,000/-

Counsel contends that the

should

be

taken

into

income of

consideration

for

determining the loss of dependency in the present case.
Counsel further contends that the deceased was survived by
his widow, two children and his mother aged about 80 years.
Counsel contends that the Tribunal has awarded a meager
MAC APP No.690/2007

page 3 of 9

amount of Rs.15,000/-towards loss of love and affection and
similar amount for the loss of consortium.
Per contra, Mr. Pradeep Gaur counsel for the
respondent no.3 insurance company vehemently refutes the
contentions of the counsel for the

appellants.

Mr. Gaur

contends that in the absence of any documentary evidence
led by the appellants, the Tribunal has rightly assessed the
income of the deceased by taking recourse to the Minimum
Wages Act.

Counsel

thus contends that no fault can be

found with the said finding of the Tribunal. On the future
prospects the contention of the counsel for the respondent is
that the deceased was admittedly
therefore,

the

Tribunal

has

of 59 years of age,

rightly

not

taken

into

consideration the future prospects of the deceased as that
is the age when one nearing his retirement. Mr.

Gaur

also

contends that even otherwise also the appellants have not
proved on record the grant of any amount towards future
prospects. As regards non-pecuniary damages, counsel for
the respondent contends that the impugned award is
MAC APP No.690/2007

page 4 of 9

absolutely just and reasonable therefore, the appellants are
not entitled to any excess amount of compensation towards
the non-pecuniary damages other than the one as granted
by the Tribunal.
I have heard

learned counsel for the parties at

great length and have also perused the record.
Perusal of the award shows that the appellants
have pleaded the income of the deceased at Rs.10,000/- per
month but failed to produce any documentary evidence on
record to show

the basis of

claiming the said monthly

income. It is no more res integra that for establishing the
income, the appellants have to place sufficient material on
record and then to prove the basis for claiming particular
income of the deceased.

Mere bald averment in the claim

petition or in the testimony would not establish the income
unless proved with the help of some cogent evidence. In this
regard in

Oriental

Insurance

Co.Ltd.

Vs.

Meena

Variyal, (2007) 5 SCC 428, the Hon'ble Apex Court has
given following observations:
MAC APP No.690/2007

page 5 of 9

“It was necessary for the claimants to
establish what was the monthly income and what
was the dependency on the basis of which the
compensation could be adjudged as payable.
Should not any Tribunal trained in law ask the
claimants to produce evidence in support of the
monthly salary or income earned by the deceased
from his employer company? Is there anything in
the Motor Vehicles Act which stands in the way of
the Tribunal asking for the best evidence,
acceptable evidence? We think not. Here again, the
position that the Motor Vehicles Act vis--vis claim
for compensation arising out of an accident is a
beneficent piece of legislation, cannot lead a
Tribunal trained in law to forget all basic principles
of establishing liability and establishing the
quantum of compensation payable. The Tribunal, in
this case, has chosen to merely go by the oral
evidence of the widow when without any difficulty
the claimants could have got the employer
Company to produce the relevant documents to
show the income that was being derived by the
deceased from his employment.”

Since in
was

the present case no documentary evidence

proved on record

Rs.10,000/-,

therefore,

to show the said income of

the

Tribunal

has

rightly

taken

recourse to the Minimum Wages Act for assessing the
income of the deceased.

The infirmity in assessing the said

income is only to the limited extent of the Tribunal taking
Raj Mistri as an unskilled labourer and to that extent finding
needs to be set aside.
MAC APP No.690/2007

Raj Mistri fall

in the category of
page 6 of 9

skilled labourer and under the Minimum Wages Act, wages
for skilled labourer as on the relevant date of the accident
i.e., 9.6.2005 were Rs.3468.90 per month say Rs.3469/- per
month. The Tribunal has applied the multiplier of 8 to the
multiplicand of Rs.24,400/-.

Once the multiplier of 8 has

been applied in assessing the loss of dependency, this Court
has already taken a view that the increase in the minimum
wages in such cases has to be taken into consideration. A
perusal of the minimum wages notified under the Minimum
Wages Act shows that to neutralize increase in inflation and
cost of living, minimum wages virtually increase more than
double after every 10 years.

The deceased was

aged 59

years and multiplier of 8 has been applied in the present
case, therefore, at least the increase in the minimum wages
for a period of five years can safely be taken into
consideration.

Minimum wages of skilled labourers in the

year 1980 was Rs.320/- p.m. and same rose to Rs.1,083/p.m. in the year 1990, meaning thereby, that
been an increase of
MAC APP No.690/2007

there has

nearly 238% in the minimum wages
page 7 of 9

from

the year 1980 to 1990.

Thus, it could be safely

assumed that the income of the deceased would have
doubled in the next 10 years. Adopting the same yardstick
there would be at least an increase of 50% i.e., Rs.5203.50,
say Rs.5264/-

after a lapse of five years and taking the

average of both, the income of the deceased comes to Rs.
4336.50 p.m. and after deducting 1/3rd from the same, the
monthly

dependency

would

Rs.34,692/- per annum.

come

to

Rs.

2891/-

and

Multiplying the same with the

multiplier of 8 years it would come to Rs.2,77,536/-.

The

amount of Rs.1,95,200/- towards the loss of dependency
awarded by the Tribunal is thus enhanced to Rs.2,77,536/-.
As regards the other contention of the counsel for
the appellants that the Tribunal has granted a meager
amount towards loss of love and affection and loss of
consortium, the amount under the

said respective heads

are increased from Rs.15,000/- to Rs.25,000/-.
The differential amount shall be paid

by the

insurance company with up-to-date interest @8% p.a. from

With these directions,appeal stands disposed of.
