1.

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
A short question arises for consideration, namely

whether right to lead secondary evidence under Section 65 of the
Indian Evidence Act 1872 pertaining to the contents of a
document has to be a 2 stage trial or a composite trial.
2.

Suffice

would

it

be

to

note

that

pertaining

to

documentary evidence, primary evidence means the document
CM(M) No.1322-23/06

Pg.No.1 of 6

itself produced for the inspection of the Court.

Secondary

evidence pertaining to documents includes the copies made from
the original by mechanical process.

But, secondary evidence

pertaining to a document can be led on the conditions specified
under Section 65 of the Indian Evidence Act 1872 which require
leading evidence pertaining to the existence of the document and
thereafter the conditions or contents of the document.
3.

The document in question is stated to be a will dated

17.12.1991. Defendant No.1 of the suit has staked a claim under
the will. He says that the original has disappeared and is not to
be found.

His application for leading secondary evidence has

been allowed.
4.

Contention of the petitioner herein that a trial must be

first held to establish that such a will existed and only thereafter
orders could be passed, on proof of existence of the will, that
contents thereof could be proved by secondary evidence.

Said

contention has not found favour with the learned Trial Judge who
opined that this course of action would require trial to be held in 2
stages; it has been held that this procedure would unnecessarily
delay the disposal of the suit.
5.

Relevant clauses of Section 65 of the Evidence Act

reads as under:CM(M) No.1322-23/06

Pg.No.2 of 6

“65.
Cases in which secondary evidence
relating to documents may be given. -Secondary
evidence may be given of the existence, condition, or
contents of a document in the following cases:(a) When the original is shown or appears to be
in the possession or powerof the person against whom the document is
sought to be proved, or of any person out of reach
of, or not subject to, the process of the Court, or
of any person legally bound to produce it,
and when, after the notice mentioned in Section
66, such person does not produce it;
(b) when the existence, condition or contents of
the original have been proved to be admitted in
writing by the person against whom it is proved or
by his representative in interest;
(c) when the original has been destroyed or lost,
or when the party offering evidence of its contents
cannot, for any other reason not arising from his
own default or neglect, produce it in reasonable
time;
(d)

...............

(e)

(f)

(g) ...............”
Learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the

6.

following authorities:(i)

AIR 1966 SC 1457, The Roman Catholic Mission vs.
State of Madras.

(ii)

AIR 1916 All. 244, Jaspat Rai & Anr. vs. Devi Dayal &

CM(M) No.1322-23/06

Pg.No.3 of 6

Ors.
(iii)

AIR (33) 1946 Privy Council 24, Babu Anand Behari Lal
vs. M/s.Dinshaw & Co., Bankers Ltd., Lucknow.

(iv)

AIR 1959 Andhra Pradesh 568, Smt. Bobba Suramma
vs. Smt. Peddireddi Chandramma.

7.

Learned counsel for respondent No.1 has cited no

authorities.
8.

I need not note the facts in dispute in the 4 captioned

authorities for the reason each decision was on its own facts and
each decision was at the appellate stage where secondary
evidence had already been led.

Issue considered in each

authority was as to how the secondary evidence had to be
evaluated pertaining to the contents of a documents. The view
taken in all the authorities is the same.

View is that before

secondary evidence pertaining to the contents of a document can
be looked into, the Court has to satisfy and record a prior finding
that there is sufficient and satisfactory evidence to hold that the
document in question did exist.
9.

As I understand the law, where original of a document

is not produced, its existence must be established by external
evidence and on satisfying itself that the document existed, can
alone the Court evaluate secondary evidence pertaining to the
CM(M) No.1322-23/06

Pg.No.4 of 6

contents of the document.

To put it differently, existence of a

document, original where is not produced, is a question of fact
required to be proved as a question of fact.

Issue regarding

contents of the document is a separate and distinct issue required
to be proved in the form of secondary evidence.
10.

But, neither the language of Section 65 nor any judicial

authority has truncated Section 65 as requiring a 2 stage trial;
stage one being production of evidence to prove the fact that the
document in dispute existed followed by a second stage trial,
upon stage one succeeding.
11.

The contrary view would obviously entail a delay in the

trial.
12.

Choked and overburdened with docket explosions,

Courts in India must find procedural ways and means to fastforward and accelerate adjudication of disputes.

If view

propounded by the petitioner is accepted, it would impede speedy
trial.
13.

Before concluding, I may note that no valuable right of

the petitioners has been infringed by the order impugned which
has clearly recorded that the Court would firstly consider, after
evidence is led, where there is evidence on record to establish
that a will in original existed.
