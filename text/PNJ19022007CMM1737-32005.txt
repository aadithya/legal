PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

A concurrent finding of fact has been returned by the

learned Additional Rent Controller and the Additional Rent Control
Tribunal against the petitioner.
2.

The respondent filed a petition for eviction against

Hirdey Bhushan Doomra, the predecessor-in-interest of the
petitioners. Petition invoked Section 14(1)(a), (b) and (j) of the
Delhi Rent Control Act 1958. It was inter alia alleged that initially
a license was granted by the petitioner to

Hirdey Bhushan

Doomra in respect of 3 rooms admeasuring 14½' x 10½', 6½' x
16½' and 14' x 6', which was later on converted into a lease. It
was stated that the tenant encroached upon an open area
adjoining the licensed area.
CM(M) 1737/05

Later on, by consent, license was

converted

into

a

lease.

Alleging

non

payment

of

rent

unauthorized subletting without the consent of the landlord as
also unauthorized constructions, eviction was prayed for.
3.

Qua the persons who were stated to be unauthorizedly

inducted it was stated that their names were Ram Saran Ahuja,
Baijnath and K.K.Pilai.
4.

After trial, learned Trial Judge, vide order dated

22.7.2002, allowed the eviction petition on all 3 counts, but giving
benefit of Section 14(2) of the D.R.C. Act 1958 passed a decree
for eviction on ground of unauthorized subletting and substantial
damage to the property. Needless to state, benefit under Section
14(10) was granted to the tenant to restore the premises to the
original position.
5.

Appeal before the Rent Control Tribunal was assigned to

Shri S.M.Chopra, Additional Rent Controller, Delhi.
6.

Vide order dated 6.4.2005, learned Additional Rent

Control Tribunal concurred with the findings of the learned
Additional Rent Controller.
7.

In the petition, various grounds have been urged to

contend that the decisions of the courts below is contrary to law.
8.

I need not note the extensive arguments advanced at

the Bar by learned counsel for the petitioner for the reason the
same required this Court to reappreciate the evidence.
9.

It is settled law that a finding of fact, more so when

there is a concurrent finding of fact by lower courts cannot be

CM(M) 1737/05

page 2 of 5

questioned by reappreciating the evidence. Of course, if it can be
shown that a material evidence has been ignored or that wrong
conclusions have been drawn from the admitted evidence, it
would be permissible for this Court to exercise its jurisdiction
under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
10.

Within the limited scope of inquiry permissible under

Article 227 of the Constitution of India, suffice would it be to note
that the entire argument of learned counsel for the petitioner was
predicated on an agreement dated 1.8.1982, Ex.RW1/A. It was
urged that the suit property was let out in terms of Ex.RW1/A and
in terms of said agreement not only was full rent paid but a power
was vested in the petitioner to further lease out the tenanted
property as also renovate the same.
11.

Case of the landlord was that 4 separate areas/halls

were let out vide lease dated Ex.RW1/A and that the suit premises
was other than the premises let out vide Ex.RW1/A. Case of the
landlord was that suit premises was initially given under a license
dated 18.9.1967 with effect from 21.2.1967, Ex.AW2/4. The said
license was subsequently converted into a lease.
12.

Both the courts below have heavily relied upon the

description of the property in Ex.RW1/A and Ex.AW2/A to conclude
that the property mentioned in Ex.AW2/A was different than the
property referred to in Ex.RW1/A.
13.

I have perused Ex.AW2/A. The dimensions of the halls

mentioned therein tally with the dimensions given in the eviction

CM(M) 1737/05

page 3 of 5

petition and as noted in para 2 above.
14.

Dimensions of the 4 open spaces/halls mentioned in

Ex.RW1/A are 38' x 15', 15' x 7', 17' x 17' and 23' x 7'.
15.

This, in my opinion is enough to reject the defence of

the petitioners vis-a-vis the issue whether the suit property was
governed by the lease dated 1.8.1982 Ex.RW1/A.
16.

But, I may note that there is other documentary

evidence consisting of admissions of the petitioner which shows
that different properties were taken by the petitioner under
different leases.
17.

Ex.PW-1/1 is the letter addressed by Hirdey Bhushan

Doomra to the Deputy Assessor and Collector, MCD on 4.5.1984.
It is in response to a notice issued by the Municipal Corporation of
Delhi on 4.5.1984.

The notice issued by the Municipal

Corporation of Delhi proposes to enhance the rateable value of
the properties in possession of Hirdey Bhushan Doomra.
18.

In

the

said

letter,

Hirdey

Bhushan

Doomra

has

categorically written that he had taken 2 different sets of property
from the landlord. Dimensions of the 2 properties tallies with the
dimensions noted in the licence agreement dated 18.9.1967,
Ex.AW2/4 and the lease agreement dated 1.8.1982, Ex.RW1/A.
19.

Ex.PW2/R2 is a letter written by Hirdey Bhushan Doomra

to the landlord acknowledging unauthorizedly occupying a strip
admeasuring 10' x 7' and agreeing to pay lease rent for the same
@Rs.2/- per sq.yds. with effect from 10.9.1981.

CM(M) 1737/05

20.

There is another interesting aspect which I may note.

21.

The eviction petition has been filed as per a proforma

prescribed.

Vide serial No.18(a) of the proforma, grounds on

which the eviction of the tenant is sought have been pleaded.
22.

In sub-para (ii) of para 18(a) it has been pleaded as

under:-

23.

“That the respondent tenant has after this 9th June 1952
sublet assigned or otherwise parted with possession of
different portions to different persons without the
consent in writing of the petitioner. The names of some
of the sub-tenants who have been unauthorizedly
inducted are Shri Ram Saran Ahuja, Shri Baijnath and Shri
K.K.Pilai.”
In the written statement filed there is no response to

said sub para (ii).
24.

While filing the written statement sub-para (i) and sub-

para (iii) of para 18(a) have been replied to.
25.

The

learned

Courts

below

have

appreciated

the

evidence on record to arrive at the findings.
26.

I have briefly noted, what according to me would be the

material documentary evidence to bring home the point that the
Courts below have acted within the scope of their respective
jurisdiction.
27.

I find no merits in the petition. The same is dismissed.

28.

LCR be returned.

29.

No costs.
