1.

By the present writ petition, the petitioner is challenging

reduction in the period of weightage allowed to him for the purposes of
computation of his pension and also reduction of the benefit of war
injury disability element in the pension granted to him. According to the
petitioner, he was commissioned to the Indian Army on 26 th January,
W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 1 of 15

1964 and was seriously injured in the Indo-Pak war of 1965.

The

petitioner was granted permanent commission and retained in the Army
despite his permanent disability on account of the injury sustained by
him. Prior to his retirement, the petitioner had attained the rank of Lt.
Colonel (Time Scale) and finally superannuated from service at the age
of 51 years on 30th November, 1989.
2.

The petitioner has alleged discrimination in grant of pension

and pensionary benefits to him consequent upon the implementation of
the recommendations of the Fifth Pay Commission with effect from 1st
January, 1996. According to the petitioner, he was informed vide letter
dated 23rd October, 1999 with regard to his pension fixation wherein he
has been allowed only five years weightage in arriving at the effective
length of service for the purposes of calculation of his pension. The
petitioner claims that since Army Officers retire at a comparatively
young age, certain number of years as weightage, rank wise, are required
to be added to the actual years of service for the purposes of computation
of the pension.

Consequent upon the implementation of the

recommendations of the Fifth Central Pay Commission with effect from
1st January, 1996, according to the petitioner, the full pension for the
respective Army Officers rank is taken as 50% of the amount comprising

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 2 of 15

minimum basic pay of the rank and the amount paid to the respective
rank. The petitioner claimed that full pension is granted for 33 years of
service as is applicable to the Civilian officers in the Central
Government. Though the petitioner places reliance on the Government
circular prescribing weightage of specified number of years for
computation of pension, the petitioner contends that the weightage
assigned to the rank of Lt. Colonel (Time Scale) is less than the
weightage prescribed for a Major. The petitioner is seeking weightage of
eight years on the ground that the prescribed weightage of five years is
discriminatory and has no nexus with the purpose sought to be achieved.
According to the petitioner, his representation to the Government of
India in this behalf dated 19th February, 2000 has been of no avail and
hence the present petition.
3.

The petitioner alleges that upon his retirement on 30th

November, 1989, initially his pension fixation was done vide PPO
No.M/1703/89 allowing the weightage of eight years. The change of
weightage from eight years to five years effected after Fifth Central Pay
Commission has caused prejudice to the petitioner and is most illegal.
4.

An application for amendment of the petition was filed

seeking to challenge the order dated 27th July, 2001 whereby the

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 3 of 15

respondents had re-fixed part of the petitioner's pension to allow
disability element of war injury pension by allowing 30% disablement.
According to the petitioner, this was done incorrectly in asmuch as in
terms of para 5 of the letter dated 3rd February, 2000 of the Government
of India, Ministry of Personnel, for disabilities assessed as less than 50%,
the disability element of pension was to be fixed at 50%. Consequently,
the petitioner being permanent disabled for life due to war injury with
30% injury assessed by the Medical Board, the petitioner is entitled to
disability pension by reckoning his disablement at 50%.
5.

Though the perusal of the records show that the amendment

application being CM No.186 of 2003 filed by the petitioner remained
pending, however, the respondents filed a counter affidavit to the
amended petition and pleadings in respect of the amended petition were
completed on record. Both the parties have argued the petition before us
if the amendment was permitted and consequently, we allow the
amendment and proceed to give our decision on the grounds raised
before us including the challenge made in the amended petition.
6.

The respondents dispute the contentions of the petitioner and

contend that their action was reasonable and fair, based on binding
government policy. According to the respondents, at the time of his

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 4 of 15

retirement on 30th November, 1989, the petitioner was holding the rank
of Lt. Colonel (Time Scale) having to his credit 25 years and 309 days
(Twenty five years three hundred & nine days) treated as 26 years of
actual qualifying service for the purposes of computation of pension. A
direction

to

this

effect

was

contained

in

letter

No.1(S)/87/D)Pension)/SCRS dated 30th October, 1987.
7.

The respondents have explained the basis and purpose for the

addition of weightage in years in qualifying service in their counter
affidavit as well as additional affidavit filed on record. It is submitted
that the Third Central Pay Commission recommended for addition of
number of years to the standard service of all ranks. The Govt. of India
during 1976 accepted the proposal and approved rank wise standard
service and weightage as follows:Age of

According to the respondents, the concept of Lt. Colonel

(Time Scale) (abbreviated as `TS') was introduced in the year 1958. At

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 5 of 15

this point of time, officers of the rank of Lt. Colonel were prescribed to
retire at the age of 48 years. Consequently, a Lt. Colonel (TS) was given
one extra year in the age of superannuation and were given additional
year of standard service vis. a vis four years more than the Major and two
years more than Lt. Colonel (Selected) abbreviated as Lt. Colonel (S).
Similarly, a Lt. Colonel (TS) was granted five years of weigtage with 26
years of standard service totaling 31 years of qualifying service for the
purposes of computation of pension. Against this, a Lt. Colonel (S) and
a Major were granted 7 years and 8 years weightage with 24 and 22 years
of standard length of service respectively. Therefore, the Lt. Colonel (S)
and a Major were treated as having 31 and 30 years respectively of total
service for the purposes of computation of of length of service with
pensionary benefits that were calculated.

The relevant portions of para 5 of the letter dated 30 th

October, 1987 read as hereunder:“5. Qualifying services

10.

It is brought to our notice that since the Fourth Central Pay

Commission's recommendations, the pensions of Lt. Colonel (TS) have
been protected against pensions of Major so as to ensure that the Lt.
Colonel (TS) does not draw pension at a rate less than what would have
been obtained by him had he not been promoted from Major to Lt.

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 7 of 15

Colonel (TS). It is submitted that an officer holding the rank of Lt.
Colonel (TS) has never been at a loss as compared to either a Lt. Colonel
or a Major.
11.

The respondents placed reliance on para 3 of the Government

of India letter which provided that the pension of the officers of the rank
of Lt. Colonel (TS) shall not be less than pension which would have been
admissible to him as a Major had he not been promoted to higher rank of
Lt. Colonel (TS).

Prior to 1st January, 1996, there was only one

integrated scale of the rank of Second Lieutenant to Brigadier which was
2300-100-3900-150-5100.
12.

Consequently, if the respondents allowed the weightage of

five years to the petitioner in terms of para 5 of the letter dated 30 th
October, 1987, of the officer holding the rank of Lt. Colonel (TS) was
entitled to weightage of five years only and as such his pension would
fall below the pension payable to the Major who is entitled to weightage
of eight years as per the said letter.
13.

The respondents state that with the intention to provide

protection of pension in terms of the Note below para 6.1 (b) in the case
of the petitioner, his pension was worked out giving him the benefit of
the weightage of eight years even though the weightage appropriately

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 8 of 15

permissible was five years only.

Upon addition of the eight years

weightage to the qualifying service of 26 years to the credit of the
petitioner, his total service came to 34 years which was restricted to 33
years and consequently he was allowed a full pension at the rate of
Rs.2,400/-

with

effect

from

1st

February,

1989

vide

PPO

No.M/CORR/50/90.
14.

In order to appreciate the action taken by the respondents, it is

necessary to consider the note appearing below para 6 of the letter dated
30th October, 1987 relied upon by the respondents which reads as under:“6.

Note: The retiring position of an officer of the rank of Lt. Col.
(TS), Brigadier or Major General and equivalent,
shall not be less than the pension which would
been admissible to him as a Major/Colonel or a
Brigadier and equivalent as the case may be, had
he not been promoted to the higher rank.”
The computation made by the respondents based on the

directive contained in the aforesaid communication of the Government of
India cannot be faulted.

The petitioner also appears to have been

satisfied by the action of the respondents inasmuch as this fixation
W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 9 of 15

carried out in terms of the aforesaid directives has not been disputed
before us.
16.

In implementation of the Fifth Central Pay Commission

recommendations, the Government of India issued a directive dated 7th
June, 1999 directing revision of the pensionary awards. The relevant
portion of the Government directive contained in the letter dated 7th June,
1999 is set out as hereunder:“2.
The revision of pension/ordinary family
pension shall be undertaken as follows:2.1 COMMISSIONED OFFICERS
Post & Pre-1.1.96 cases

17.

(a) Pension shall continue to be calculated at 50% of
the average emoluments in all cases and shall be subject
to a minimum of Rs.1275/- p.m. and a maximum of upto
50% of the highest pay applicable to Armed Forces
personnel but the full pension in no case shall be less
than 50% of the minimum of the revised scale of pay
introduced w.e.f. 1.1.96 for the rank last held by the
Commissioned Officer at the time of his/her retirement.
However, such pension shall be reduced pro-rata, where
the pensioner has less than the maximum required
service for full pension.”
Therefore, under the provisions of the Government of India

letter dated 7th June, 1999, calculations of the pension was to be effected
on the basis of the last rank held by the officers and the pay scale
introduced with effect from 1st January, 1996.

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 10 of 15

18.

The respondents contend that there has been no change in the

number of years in weightage as are admissible to a Lt. Colonel (TS)
even after the implementation of the recommendations of the Fifth
Central Pay Commission.
19.

As already noticed hereinabove, prior to 1st January, 1996

there were only one integrated scale of pay set out hereinabove.
However, separate pay scale has been provided for the purpose of Lt.
Colonel (TS) with effect from 1st January, 1996.

The permissible

weightage as admissible to a Lt. Colonel (TS) even after implementation
of the recommendations of the Fifth Central Pay Commission remained
as five years.

Consequently, the respondents effected computation of

the pension in accordance with the applicable rule giving the benefit of
five year weightage as was admissible to the petitioner who was holding
the rank of Lt. Colonel (TS) upon the pay scale to which the Lt. Colonel
(TS) was now entitled.
20.

There is no challenge to the prescription by the Government

of India or to the applicable policy for grant or computation of weightage
in service in the petition before us. The petitioner has not been able to
point out any illegality or any instance whereby the petitioner could
successfully urge his plea of discrimination. The petitioner has also not

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 11 of 15

submitted that the computation of his pension after the implementation of
the Fifth Central Pay Commission was not in terms of the Government
of India letter dated 30th October, 1987 as stated hereinabove.
Consequently, we are unable to find anything in favour of the petitioner
to the effect that any injustice was meted out to him in computation of his
qualifying service for pension or that the petitioner has been
discriminated against in any manner.
21.

The petitioner has further contended that he has not been paid

the correct war injury disability element pension on the recommendations
of the Fifth Central Pay Commission. The petitioner has contended that
these recommendations were circulated by the Ministry of Personnel,
Public Grievances and Pensions vide circular No.45/22/97-P & PW(C)
dated 3rd February, 2000. According to the petitioner, the provisions of
the circular were applicable to persons who retired both prior and
subsequent to 1st January, 1996. According to the petitioner, it was
mandatory for all authorities, including the respondents to implement the
guidelines mentioned in this circular.

According to the petitioner,

whereas the respondents have complied with the requirement of para 5
(ii) of the circular dated 3rd February, 2000 with regard to permanent
duration of the petitioner's disability and have issued a letter dated 21 st

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 12 of 15

July, 2002, however, the respondents have failed to round off the extent
of disability in the case of the petitioner for the purposes of computation
of disability pension. According to the petitioner, the circular dated 3rd
February, 2000 required that persons having disability of less than 30%
were entitled to weightage of 50% disability pension.
22.

The question being agitated by the petitioner arose for

consideration in writ petition (C) No.5603/2002 entitled Col. B.S.
Dhanda Vs. UOI & another wherein vide a judgment dated 1st of March,
2004 it was held hereunder:“ xxx

xxx

xxx

xxx

From the aforesaid provisions in para 6, it
would be clear that as far as the rate of disability
element is concerned that will be governed as per the
rates indicated in para 7.1 of the notification dated 31st
January, 2001. Para 7.1 (II) (a) deals with rate of
disability element. Whereas para 7.2 deals with the
percentage of disability.
Pursuant to the provision
made in para 6 of the notification, the percentage of
disability has been excluded and, therefore, pensioners
who have retired before 1.1.1996 cannot claim, as a
matter of right, for enhancement of percentage of
disability.
Therefore, we do not find force in the
arguments of the petitioner that in the case of
petitioners who have retired prior to 1.1.1996 would be
entitled for assessment of percentage of disability in
terms of paragraph 7.2 of notification dated 31st
January, 2001.
W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 13 of 15

Therefore, in our considered opinion it
cannot be said that in case of the revision of higher rates
for disability pension for pensioners who have retired
prior to 1.1.1996, the percentage of disability will also
stand revised in terms of the notification issued on 31st
January, 2001. The increase of percentage and rate has
been done by issuance of specific notifications. The
petitioner has not challenged non-grant of higher
percentage of disability pension to pensioners who have
retired on or before 1st January, 1996 on the ground of
discrimination as those who were retiring after 1st
January, 1996 have been granted a higher percentage of
disability pension, although they have been assessed
less than 50% of disability, therefore, no writ can be
issued on that count in favour of the petitioners.
xxx

23.

xxx

Net result of the discussion is that those
pensioners who have retired prior to 1.1.1996 will be
entitled to a higher rate of disability pension as envisaged
and provided in notification dated 31st January, 2001. But
their percentage of disability will not be enhanced to 50%
as prayed for in this writ petition. However, they will be
entitled to be paid on the basis of the disability assessed by
the medical board.”
The issues raised by the petitioner stands on all fours with the

decision of the Division Bench in Col. B.S. Dhanda (Supra). After
consideration of the circular as well as the material on record, we are
unable to agree with the contentions of the petitioner. The circular dated
3rd February, 2000 relied upon by the petitioner is applicable only to
civilian government servants and as such would not be applicable to the

W.P. (C) No.268/2001

page 14 of 15

petitioner who is a retired army officer. The petitioner retired from
service on 30th November, 1989. Reliance placed by the petitioner on the
letter dated 31st January, 2001 is also misconceived inasmuch as the same
applies to only officers who were in service on or after 1st January, 1996.
We find that the disability element has been correctly fixed by the
respondents at 30% in the case of the petitioner.
24.

The petitioner is not entitled to any of the reliefs sought for.

25.

For the foregoing reasons, we find no merit in the writ

petition which is hereby dismissed.
