No.116/Del/2001 relating to block period 1st April, 1988 to
21st April, 1998.
2.

Vide the impugned order, the Tribunal has deleted the

addition of Rs.26.05 lacs made on account of unexplained
loans advanced by the Assessee and the interest earned
thereon.
3.

The facts in brief are that the residence of the

Assessee at K-101,

Hauz Khas Enclave, New Delhi, was

searched under Section 132 of the Act on 21st April, 1998.
During the course of search, certain documents containing
details

of

certain

monetary

transactions

such

as

advancement of loan of Rs.22.50 lacs by the Assessee and
also income by way of interest thereof at Rs.3.55 lacs were
found. The Assessing Officer vide questionnaire dated 27th
January, 2000 required the Assessee to explain the
expenditure.

The explanation given by the Assessee that

the account belongs to his daughter Smt.Sarla Gupta was
denied by her.

The Assessing Officer concluded in his

assessment order that the Assessee had earned income
ITA No.900/2006

Page 2 of 10

from undisclosed sources which was circulated by way of
loan for the purpose of earning interest. Thus, the amount
of Rs. 22.5 lacs and interest of Rs.3.5 lacs were added to
the income of the Assessee for the assessment year 199899.
4.

Assessee being aggrieved against

the assessment

order, preferred an appeal before Commissioner of Income
Tax (Appeals) which was allowed.
5.

The Revenue challenged the order of Commissioner of

Income Tax (Appeals) before the Tribunal and the Tribunal
vide impugned order dismissed the appeal of the Revenue.
6.

It has been argued by the learned counsel for the

Revenue that the Assessee has failed to substantiate the
transactions with any evidence and also failed to explain
the source thereof.
Assessee

that

the

The explanation tendered by the
account

belongs

to

his

daughter

Smt.Sarla Gupta was categorically denied by her and in
view of her specific denial, there is no justification to hold
it otherwise. The Assessee also failed to rebut the
presumption available under Section 132(4A) of the Act and
it is nobody's case that document was not in the hand
ITA No.900/2006

Page 3 of 10

writing of the Assessee and, thus, the document being
found in the possession and control of the Assessee, the
burden lies upon him to rebut the presumption.
7.

On the other hand, learned counsel for the Assessee

has contended that Revenue has not been able to adduce
evidence to show that the Assessee earned income relating
to the entry or earned interest thereon.

There is no

evidence to show that the Assessee was advancing any
money on interest or had any funds

for lending.

It is

further contended that the document in this case is a dumb
document and it does not lead to any conclusion and in
support his contention, learned counsel for the Assessee
cited a decision of Apex Court reported as Mahavir

Woolen Mills v. Commissioner of Income Tax (2000)
245 ITR 297.
8.

Another contention is that since the documents seized

in this case are dumb document as per the finding of
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) and Tribunal and
this conclusion is a factual one and, thus, no substantial
question of law arises in this case.
9.

Relevant portion of the assessment order with regard

ITA No.900/2006

Page 4 of 10

to this document reads as under:“ Annexure A-28 page 15, gives the details
of
certain
handwritten
monetary
transactions which shows that the assessee
had given a loan of Rs.22.5 lacs on interest
and earned interest income of Rs.3.55 lacs
on it. The details of the account began
from 1.4.97 and the other dated recorded
was found 5.1.98 and the interest was
calculated on the first day of April 1998.
The assessee was asked to substantiate
these transactions with supporting and
necessary evidences and to explain the
sources of these amounts. The assessee
vide letter dated 10.2.2000 stated that this
is an account of Smt.Sarla Gupta, the
assessee's daughter, Summons u/s 131 of
the Income Tax Act, 1961 were issued to
Smt.Sarla Agarwal and a statement was
recorded on 7.4.2000. She categorically
stated that she is a housewife and
dependent on her husband for household
and misc. expenses and she does not have
any source of income independently and
she has not visited her father's house
during 1997 except for a brief period to
invite him for her daughter's marriage. She
stated that she is living separately with her
husband at their residence at C-39, NDSEII, New Delhi, and she never gave any
account of any money to her father. A
perusal of this diary shows that the
assessee is a very meticulous person and
keeps his accounts promptly and regularly.
Certain markings with the pencil also
shows that he never delays in recording the
amounts that are paid and received. A
perusal of this account also shows that a
detailed account of the amounts that are
given on interest against various names like
ITA No.900/2006

Page 5 of 10

10.

Kharbanda etc. are mentioned and the dues
taken back are recorded in Hindi as “all
dues taken 31.3.98”. The interest for the 1st
of April was also calculated and recorded
adjacent to the account of all dues taken
back. Therefore, is clearly evident that the
assessee
had
earned
income
from
undisclosed sources and have circulated
amongst various persons and earned
interest on them.
These payments and
receipts are not shown in the returns filed
by the assessee. In light of the above
discussions, an amount of Rs.22,50,000/and the interest earned on it amounting to
Rs.3,55,000/- is added back to the income
of the assessee for the A.Y.1998-99.
Therefore, total amount of Rs.26,05,000/- is
added back to the income for the A.Y.199899.”
The relevant finding of the Tribunal is as under:“The version of the assessee was that
these
entries
related
to
his
daughter,namely, Smt.Sarla Gupta. This
version was very specific. After Smt.Sarla
Gupta denied to have any transaction with
the assessee, it was incumbent for the
department to have confronted the
assessee against the contents of this
document. It is significant to point out
that the statement of Smt.Salra Gupta
was recorded by the Assessing Officer on
7.4.2000. The assessee was not called to
cross examine her. Further, the statement
of the assessee himself was not recorded
at any stage during the assessment
proceedings. It is further to be pointed
out that after recorded of the statement of
Smt.Sarla Gupta detailed questionnaire
was subsequently given to the assessee
but no query was made regarding this

ITA No.900/2006

Page 6 of 10

document. In view of these facts, the
learned CIT(A) was justified in reversing
the conclusion drawn by the Assessing
Officer.
The evidentiary value of a
document is to be considered on the basis
of its proof. If the evidence collected
against a person has not been confronted
against him then it cannot be utilized
against him. In the present case, the
Assessing Officer has taken into account
the statement of Smt.Sarla Gupta and has
utilized the same against the assessee but
the fact remains that this statement was
recorded behind the back of the assessee
and no opportunity was given to him to
cross examine her.

11.

“We have ourselves examined the contents
of the document and are unable to draw
any clear and positive conclusion on the
basis of figures noted on it. The letters
'H.S.', 'T.2' and 'D-Shop' cannot be
explained and no material has been
collected to explain the same. Likewise,
the figures too are totally unexplained and
on the basis of notings and jottings, it
cannot be said that these are the
transactions carried out by the assessee
for advancing money or for taking money.
Thus, in our opinion, this is a dumb
document.”
In the present case the Assessing Officer has placed

reliance on the statement of Smt.Sarla Aggarwal, daughter
of the Assessee while arriving at the conclusion, that the
entries belong to the transactions of the Assessee.

This

statement made by Smt.Sarla Gupta, cannot be said to be

ITA No.900/2006

Page 7 of 10

relevant or admissible evidence against the Assessee, since
the Assessee was not given any opportunity to crossexamine her and even from the statement, no conclusion
can be drawn that the entries made on the relevant page
belongs to the Assessee and represents his undisclosed
income. It is also an admitted fact that the statement of the
Assessee was not recorded at any stage during the
assessment proceedings. The only conclusion which can be
drawn about the nature and contents of the document is
that it is a dumb document and on the basis of the entry of
notings or figure etc. in this document, it cannot be
concluded that this represents the undisclosed income of
the Assessee.
10.

It is well settled that the only person competent to

give evidence on the truthfulness of the contents of the
document is the writer thereof.

So, unless and until the

contents of the document are proved against a person, the
possession of the document or hand writing of that person,
on such document by itself cannot prove the contents of the
document. These are the findings of fact recorded by both
the authorities, i.e., Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals)
ITA No.900/2006

Page 8 of 10

and the Tribunal.
11.

In Mahavir Woolen Mills (supra) case, during the

course of search and seizure proceedings, certain slips
were found, which, the Assessing Officer concluded,
contained details of

payment beyond those which were

made by cheques and drafts and were duly reflected in the
books of accounts.

The Assessee's stand before the

Tribunal was that the documents were “dumb documents”
which did not contain full details about the dates of
payment and its contents were not corroborated by any
material and could not be relied upon and made the basis
of addition.

The Tribunal considered this aspect and

observed that on comparison of the seized documents and
ledger accounts of the parties, the seized documents could
not be regarded as “dumb documents”.
12.

While dismissing the appeal, the Apex Court held:“That the Tribunal had come to a certain
factual conclusion about the nature of the
papers seized. On the question whether
the documents did or did not contain the
particulars, the tribunal observed that
they did contain certain materials which
were sufficient to come to a conclusion
about cash payments having been made in
addition to those made by cheques and
drafts.
The conclusion was essentially
factual. No substantial question of law
arose from its order.”

13.

Similarly, in the present case as already held above,

the documents recovered during the course of search from

Since the

conclusions are essentially factual, no substantial question
of law arises for consideration.
14.

The above being the position, no fault can be found

with the view taken by the Tribunal. Thus, the order of the
Tribunal does not give rise to a question of law, much less a
substantial question of law, to fall within the limited
purview of Section 260-A of the Act, which is confined to
entertaining only such appeal against the order which
involves a substantial question of law.
15.

Accordingly, the present appeal filed by the Revenue

is, hereby, dismissed.
