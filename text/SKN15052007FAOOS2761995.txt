SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1.
The present appeals arise out of different orders passed in Civil
Suit No. 2280/1991 titled Capricon One and Another versus Raghbir
Singh and Others.
2.

FAO(OS) No. 276/1995 has been filed by M/s. Capricorn One

and Mr. I.S. Bawa against order dated 16th October, 1995 disposing
of injunction application IA No. 8803/1991 and another similar
application being IA No. 8561/1995.

By the said order, learned

Single Judge partially allowed the injunction application, inter alia,
holding that the defendant Mr. Raghbir Singh who is the respondent
No.1 in appeal No. 276/1995 should be restrained from selling the
property comprised in khasra No. 207 as per the description given in
the plaint. In view of the stand taken by Major Bhajan Pratap Singh
and Ms. Usha Pratap Singh, the respondent Nos. 2 and 3 in this
appeal, who were also impleaded as parties to the suit by the same
order dated 16th October, 1995, learned Single Judge held that the
said defendants claim their right in respect of property purchased by
them from Mr. Raghbir Singh, in khasra No. 162 and the said khasra
is not subject matter of the suit and, therefore, the appellantsplaintiffs have nothing to do with the said land. Accordingly no

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 3

injunction order was passed against the Respondent No.s 2 and 3
herein.
3. FAO (OS) No. 343/1995 is a cross appeal filed by Major Bhajan
Pratap Singh and Ms. Usha Pratap Singh against the appellants in
FAO(OS) No. 276/1995, M/s Capricorn One and Mr. I.S. Bawa. Mr.
Raghbir Pratap Singh is also a respondent. The appellants Major
Bhajan Pratap Singh and Ms. Usha Pratap Singh have challenged
order dated 16th October, 1995 allowing IA No. 3240/1994 by which
the said parties were impleaded as defendants.
4.

FAO(OS) No. 378/1999 is directed against order dated 27th

July, 1999 passed in IA No. 3900/1997 dismissing the application
filed by Capricorn One, under Order VI Rule 17 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the Act, for short).
5.

As all the appeals are inter-connected and common facts and

issues are involved, they are being disposed of by this common
order.
6.

For the sake of convenience, M/s Capricorn One, the appellant

in FAO(OS) No. 276/1995 and FAO(OS) No. 378/1999 has been
referred to as 'Capricorn', Mr. Raghbir Singh has been referred to as
'Raghbir' and Major Bhajan Pratap Singh and Ms. Usha Pratap Singh
appellants in FAO(OS) No. 343/1995 have been collectively referred

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 4

to as 'Singhs'.
7.

For deciding the present appeals, it is necessary to capitulate

facts as found from a reading of the pleadings and the orders
passed. It is, however, clarified that the facts as stated below are on
the basis of prima facie opinion formed by this Court and should not
be construed as final determination of the factual position. The final
determination can take place only after parties have been given
opportunity to lead oral evidence.
8.

Capricorn

has

filed

a

Suit

No.2280/1991

for

specific

performance of contract, possession and perpetual injunction.
Capricorn claims to have entered into an agreement to sell dated 6th
March, 1990 with Raghbir for purchase of 432 square yards of land
situated at village katwaria Sarai, Mehrauli, New Delhi in khasra No.
207 (Min) as per the jababandi dated 26th -28th August, 1986. It is,
however, stated in the plaint that the original agreement to sell has
been lost and photocopy thereof is available with Capricorn. It is
further alleged in the plaint that Raghbir had agreed to sell the said
land @ Rs.5,500/- per square

yard i.e. for total consideration of

Rs.23,76,000/- out of which Rs.4,00,000/- was paid by cheque at the
time of the signing of the agreement to sell leaving a balance
payment of Rs.19,76,000/-. Boundaries of the said plot/land subject

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

matter of the suit has been described in paragraph 3 of the plaint as
under:“East

-

Village street
Property of Shri Pratap Singh
Service Lane (Gali)
The main road of Qutab Hotel”

Similar description is also given in the photocopy of the

agreement to sell dated 6th March, 1990 relied upon by Capricorn.
Along with the plaint, Capricorn has also filed Form No. 37-I for
furnishing statement of transfer of immovable property before
appropriate authority under Chapter XX-C of the Income-Tax Act,
1961 and Form No. 34-A under Section 230A of the same Act. In
Form No. 37-I, the immovable property intended to be transferred
has been described as “F26, Katwaria Sarai Village, New Delhi”.
Capricorn also rely upon an affidavit dated 16th March, 1990
purportedly executed by Raghbir in which the property made subject
matter of the sale measures 432 square yards in Katwaria Sarai,
Mehrauli, New Delhi located in khasra No. 207(Min) has been
described as plot No. 126. Along with the plaint, a copy of the site
plan of the property subject matter of the plaint has been enclosed.
10.

Raghbir, in the very first paragraph of the written statement has

stated that the suit has not been properly valued as the land subject

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 6

matter of of the plaint is 539 square yards in area and it was verbally
agreed by Raghbir that he would sell the said land to Capricorn @
Rs.6,000/-

Rs.32,34,000/-.

i.e.

of

It is, however, alleged that there was no written

agreement between Raghbir and Capricorn. In paragraph 6 of the
preliminary objections, Raghbir has stated as under:“6.That the plaintiffs want to grab the property
namely F-126, Katwaria Sarai, Delhi
measuring 539 sq. yds. through the forged
agreement prepared by the plaintiffs. In fact
there was
no written agreement dated
6.3.1990 between the parties to the suit.”
11.

Similarly in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the reply on merits, it has

been stated as under:“3. That para 3 of the plaint as it is stated is
wrong and denied. It is denied that the
plaintiffs approach the defendant through Shir
Vinod Khatri, a property dealer for the
purchase of the land in suit of the defendant.
It is denied that the defendant agreed to sell
the land measuring 432 sq. yds. as alleged
out of khasra No. 207 situated in the revenue
estate of Village Katwaria Sarai, New Delhi to
the plaintiff's firm. However it is disclose that
the suit property is measuring 539 sq. yds. It
is denied that the suit property is measuring
432 sq. yds. or it is 452 sq. yds.
It is
mentioned that the figure 452 sq. yds. was
misprint in the notice of the Advocate and it
is a typographical mistake of the typist. The
exact measurement of the plot is 539 sq. yds
(77'x63').

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

4. That para 4 of the plaint is wrong and
denied. It is denied that in accordance with
the aforesaid agreement as alleged, the
plaintiffs agreed to purchase a land of the
defendant for a sum of Rs.5500/- per sq. yds.
totalling the approximate sale consideration of
Rs.23,76,000/- (Rupees Twenty three lacs
and seventy six thousand only) etc. etc. It is
admitted
that
the
defendant
took
Rs.4,00,000/- as the earnest money against
the total sale consideration of Rs.32,34,000/in respect of the suit property. The aforesaid
amount was given by Shri Vinod Varshneya in
terms of the verbal agreement. Annexure 'E'
filed by the plaintiff is wrong and denied. The
defendant challenges the genuineness and
authenticity of Annexure 'E'. The contents of
para 4 of the plaint are totally false and the
same are denied.
That Shri Varshney approached Shri Raghbir
Singh, the defendant on 6.3.90 and proposed
him for the sale for his plot No. F-126, Katwari
Sarai, New Delhi measuring 539 sq. yds. and
(77'x63') at the rate of Rs.6000/- per sq. yds.
which Shri Raghbir Singh the defendant
accepted the offer of Shri Varshneya and a
sum of Rs.4,00,000/- through cheque was
paid to Shri Raghbir Singh as an earnest
money against the total sale consideration of
Rs.32,34,000/- and it was verbally agreed that
Shri Raghbir Singh shall sign all the
documents namely agreement to sell,
Receipts, General Power of Attorney, Special
Power of Attorney, Will and any other
document which may help Shri Varshneya for
the transfer of the said plot in his name when
the balance amount will be paid to Shri
Raghbir Singh and this was to be done within
90 days with effect from 6.3.90. However, it

Page 7

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 8

is disclosed that Shri Raghbir Singh put his
signatures on the five blank papers on the
assurance of Shri Vinod Varshneya and Shri
Rajvir Singh. The said papers are in the
custody of Shri Varshneya. The present suit
is the net result of the bed(sic) intentions, ill
motives, and bed designs between Shri
Varshneya and Shri Rajvir Singh.”
12.

The stand taken by Raghbir in the written statement is that he

can write his name in Hindi and English language but otherwise is
illiterate. He denied authenticity of the Form No. 37-I, 34-A, affidavit
dated 16th March, 1999 and the agreement to sell claiming that these
are forged and bogus and have been prepared by Capricorn to grab
the property.

It is also alleged that Raghbir had signed papers

produced before him. Raghbir admitted that legal notice dated 16th
August, 1990 was issued on his behalf to Capricorn for payment of
the balance sale consideration and execution of papers by 2nd
September, 1990 but claimed that the date mentioned for execution
of the said documents i.e., 2nd September, 1990 was wrongfully
typed by the typist and is a mere typographical error and time for
making balance payment had already expired. It was further alleged
that Raghbir is bed ridden since November, 1991. In the written
statement Raghbir further states that there were various defaults by
Capricorn. However, Raghbir admits that he was paid Rs.4,00,000/-

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 9

as earnest money.
13.

It is the case of the Capricorn that during the pendency of the

said suit, there were some talks of compromise and Capricorn relies
upon a compromise deed dated 21st January, 1994 purportedly
executed by it's partner Ms. Mohinder Kaur and Raghbir. As per the
said compromise deed, Capricorn had agreed to pay balance sale
consideration of Rs.19,76,000/- and Raghbir Singh had agreed to
execute sale deed of the property described as 126, Katwaria Sarai,
New Delhi measuring 432 square yards comprised in 207 (Min) as
per the site plan enclosed. The compromise deed also records that
cheque of the aforesaid balance amount has been handed over.
14.

It appears that the compromise was never recorded in the

court and later on Raghbir filed an affidavit dated 16th May, 1994
before the learned Single Judge claiming that he owned and was in
possession of two lands viz. 432 square yards in khasra No. 207
(Min) and approximately 536 square yards in khasra No. 162 (Min)
also situated in Katwaria Sarai, Tehsil Mehrauli, New Delhi. In this
affidavit, Raghbir has further stated that in 1990 he had offered to
sell the two plots, @ Rs.5,500/- per square yards

for the plot

measuring approximately 432 square yards in khasra No. 207 (Min)
and Rs.6,000/- per square yards for 536 square yards of land in

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 10

khasra No. 162 (Min) katwaria Sarai, New Delhi. It is further alleged
that Capricorn had agreed and Raghbir had entered into an
agreement to sell of land situated in khasra No. 207 (Min), Katwaria
Sarai, New Delhi for Rs.23,76,000/- @ Rs.5,500/- per square yard
and accordingly made payment of Rs.4,00,000/- leaving a balance
payment of Rs.19,76,000/-, which was to be paid within 90 days.
Raghbir also alleges that he had signed blank papers and
documents as he is old and is not well educated.

His age as

mentioned in the affidavit dated 16th May, 1994 was 62 years. It is
also averred in the affidavit that on 5th January, 1994, Raghbir had
sold 536 square yards of land in khasra No. 162 (Min) Katwaria
Sarai, New Delhi to the Singhs vide separate sale deeds. The
affidavit states that the land for which the suit has been filed consists
of 432 square yards in khasra No. 207 (Min) and the same is distinct
and separate from 536 square yards' of land in khasra No. 162 (Min)
in village Katwaria Sarai, New Delhi sold by Raghbir to the Singhs. It
is stated that the two lands are not in any manner connected or
common. In this regard Raghbir has also relied upon the records
enclosed with the affidavit. The 536 square yards of land in khasra
No. 162 (Min) has been described as plot No. 126 (new number F126) in the affidavit.

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

15.

Page 11

It may be stated that Raghbir has not amended the written

statement.

Normally an affidavit cannot be filed contrary to

averments made in the written statement. Provisions of Order VI
Rules 7, 8 and 9 read with order VIII, Rule 9 of the Code are clear in
this respect. They prohibit and bar a party from filing contradictory
pleadings. (Refer Kedar Nath versus Ram Prakash, reported in
1998 (76) DLT 755, FB) However, this aspect will have to be
examined and gone into by the learned trial court. We refrain from
expressing and giving final opinion in this regard lest it causes
prejudice to any side and our opinion is only prima facie and
tentative for the purpose of deciding the present appeals.
16.

The stand of the Singhs has been that the properties

purchased by them are located in khasra No. 162 (Min) and are
known as plot No. F-126, Katwaria Sarai, New Delhi and the said
properties are not subject matter of the suit, they being distinct and
separate. The Singhs referred to the averments made in the plaint
wherein the suit property has been described as located in khasra
No. 207 (Min) comprising of 432 square yards whereas property No.
F-126, it is claimed is located in 162 (Min) and comprises of 539
square yards of land. Reliance in this regard is also placed upon the
records given by Patwari, village katwaria Sarai dated 4th January,

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 12

2007 in which he has stated that khasra No. 207 (Min) and 162 are
mutually distinct and separate and are located approx. 2500 ft. apart.
17.

However, in the said report, the Patwari has stated that plot

No. F-126 falls in khasra No. 171 and does not fall in khasra No. 162
or 207. Thus, as per the report given by the Patwari, plot No. 126
does not form part of the khasra No. 162 (Min), which had been
purchased by the Singhs as per the documents filed by them. It is
further stated by the Patwari that khasra No. 207 is owned by the
Government and is in possession of Housing Department.
18.

It may be relevant to state here that the learned Single Judge

had also appointed a Local Commissioner to visit the spot for
identification of the suit property.

The Local Commissioner

appointed by the learned Single Judge had submitted his report. He
had also prepared a site plan. As per the report, property No. F-126
or 126 is one and the same and the plot is open on three side. On
one side of the plot there is the main road and back side there is a
small service or by- lane. On the North side of the property, is plot
No. 125 which is owned by Choudhary Pratap Singh. The report
also reveals that construction and demolition on Plot No. F 126,
Katwaria Sarai was started as per the statement made by
neighbours, two months before the date of the report i.e. in April,

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 13

1994.
19.

The facts stated above reveal that the Singhs have raised a

dispute about identity of the property which was subject matter of the
agreement between Raghbir and Capricorn. It is the case of the
Singhs that plot No. F-126 is not the suit property and was never
subject matter of the agreement between Capricorn and Raghbir, as
the property which is the subject matter of the agreement as per the
plaint is located in khasra No. 207 (Min). Raghbir had not disputed
the identity of the property in the written statement. In the written
statement he had referred to the suit property as F-126. Raghbir had
infact in the written statement stated that the property is not 432
Square yards in size but 539 Square yards in size. The relevant
portion of the written statement has been quoted above. In the
affidavit dated 16th March, 1990 purportedly executed by Raghbir the
property subject matter of the agreement between Raghbir and
Capriron has been described as F-126. There is also dispute with
regard to total area of the plot No. F-126. Raghbir and the Singhs
claim that it is 539 square yards whereas as per the Capricorn, the
agreement between Raghbir and the Capricorn was in respect of
432 square yards of land. However, we may mention here that the
report given by Patwari shows that F-126 does not fall in either

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 14

khasra No. 207 or 162 and, therefore, is not owned by either
by

the

Capricorn

or

by

the

Singhs,

if one goes by the khasra nos. mentioned in the documents relied
upon by them. However, we also have copy of the site plan relied
upon by Capricorn and the description of the property given in
paragraph 3 of the plaint which has not been disputed and denied by
Raghbir, in the corresponding paragraph of the written statement
which has also been reproduced above in the present order.
20.

The demarcation of property which was subject matter of

agreement between Raghbir and Capricorn will be subject matter of
trial. Only after the parties have led oral evidence on this issue, can
this factual question be finally decided. However, in the plaint and in
the alleged agreement to sell, description of the property by giving
boundaries of the same has been given. In view of the factual
position discussed above, we feel that on the basis of documents
and pleadings, the appellant has been able to make out a prima
facie case for injunction in respect of the plot purchased by the
Singhs from Raghbir.
21.

Learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Single

Judge in the order dated 27th July, 1999 while disposing of
application for amendment viz. IA No. 3900/1997 has referred to

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 15

some decisions of this Court and other High Courts in the case of
Bimla Khanna versus M.S. Pawar and Others, reported in 48
(1992) DLT 272, Bhagwan Dass & Another versus Union of India,
reported in AIR 1980 Delhi 197, Umsala Bibi & Others versus M.
Jayaraman, reported in AIR 1988 Madras 145, Krishan Lal Datta
versus Behari Lal Chhabra, reported in 36 (1988) DLT 324 and
Chhajju Ram versus Lachhman Singh, reported in 31 (1987) DLT
10. In the said decisions, the courts have referred to the manner
and the mode in which the identification of the property is decided in
case of a dispute. In some of the decisions it has been held that
description by giving details of boundaries can be a relevant criteria
for determining identity of the plot or land. Therefore, it is not the
plot number or description by khasra number which is the final,
determinative or conclusive criteria for finding out the identity of the
plot, but the boundary details given in the document and the
pleadings. We do not want to express any final opinion in this regard
as all these aspects are required to be examined by the trial court at
the time of final decision.
22.

We may, however, mention here that while issuing notice in

FAO (OS) No. 276/1995 in order dated 27th October, 1995,

the

Division Bench of this Court had noticed various contentions raised

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 16

by Capricorn and finding merit in the same had restrained Raghbir
and Singhs from executing and entering into transaction to sell etc.
in respect of property which is subject matter of the suit and also
subject matter of the sale deed. While doing so, court also recorded
the submission of Capricorn that there was no distinction between
the suit property and plot No. F-126.

This aspect was again

considered by the Division Bench of this Court in the order dated 14th
August, 1997. It was noticed that the dispute prima facie relates to
identification of the property. It was recorded that the Singhs will be
bound by the injunction order if they have purchased the suit
property as described in the plaint and covered by the agreement.
Liberty was given to the Singhs to file objections to the report of the
Local Commissioner. The said injunction order has continued.
23.

In the light of the above position, we feel that for the purpose of

interim injunction, the restraint order already passed should continue
against Raghbir as well as the Singhs. For the sake of clarification
and lest there be any ambiguity, Raghbir and Singhs are specifically
restrained from further transferring, alienating, mortgaging or
creating any further charge in respect of plot No. F-126, Katwaria
Sarai, New Delhi till the disposal of the suit.

The Singhs have

constructed on the property and rented it out. They shall file an

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 17

affidavit in the suit before the learned Single Judge giving details of
the tenants, the area occupied by them and the monthly rental being
received by them from the tenants.

Copy of the agreements

between them and the tenants will be filed along with the affidavit.
The Singhs will be entitled to re-let the property without creating any
other right, charge or mortgage but will file an affidavit in the court
informing the court the name and address of the tenant,alongwith
copy of the agreement between them and the tenant and the rent
being received.
24.

As far as amendment application is concerned, we feel the

same should also be allowed and Capricorn should be permitted to
allege that the property which is subject matter of the agreement to
sell between them and Raghbir is none other than plot No. F-126,
Katwaria Sarai, New Delhi. As already stated above, identity of the
plot subject matter of the plaint is disputed. The amendment,
therefore, is only clarificatory. However, this will be subject to the
condition that Capricorn will not delete the averment made in the
plaint that the said plot is located in khasra No. 207, village Katwaria
Sarai, New Delhi. Of course, it will be open to the parties to explain
by leading evidence that the plot which was subject matter of the
agreement to sell between Raghbir and Capricorn is different or

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 18

same as that purchased by Singhs from Raghbir and in case khasra
number has been incorrectly mentioned, the reason and cause for
the same and effect thereof shall be considered by the Learned
Single Judge. Accordingly, amended para 3 of the plaint will read as
under:“That the plaintiff approached the
defendant
through Shri Vinod Khatri
Associates, Kishangarh, Mehrauli, New Delhi
for the purchase of the land and the defendant
agreed to sell the land measuring about 432
Sq.yards out of Khasra No. 207 (min) situated
at Village Katwaria Sarai, New Delhi, to the
plaintiff firm and accordingly the plaintiff firm
through its authorised signatory i.e. plaintiff
No.2 Shri I S Bawa entered into a written
agreement with the defendant, Shri Raghbir
Singh son of late Shri Shiv Lal resident of C971, Netaji Nagar, New Delhi, executed on 63-1990 and the same was duly signed by both
the parties. The said plot is also identified
as 126 (old) and F-126 (new), Katwaria
Sarai, Tehsil Mehrauli, New Delhi. The
boundaries of the said plot/land is as under:East :
North :
West :
South :

Village street
Service lane (Gali)
Property of Shri Pratap Singh
Main Road of Qutab Hotel

The copy of the said agreement is
annexed herewith as Annexure 'A'. The
defendant also gave his sworn attested
affidavit on 16.3.1990 in support of this
agreement dated 6.3.1990 and the proposed
site plan and other relevant papers like
income tax clearance form 37-I, 34-A were

FAO (OS) Nos. 276/1995, 378/1999 & 343/1995

Page 19

also signed by the defendant, from time to
time, the photocopies of the same are
annexed herewith as Annexures 'B' to 'D'.
However, some construction exists at the site
and the existing site plan is annexed herewith
as Annexure D-II.”
25.
