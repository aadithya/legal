dated 18th January, 2006.

The respondent no.1/applicant contended that he was working

under the petitioner on the wages of Rs.1500/-P.M. The respondent
no.1/applicant was terminated by the petitioner on 14th January,1999
and he is unemployed since then. The applicant contended that he is
passing through a very bad phase since the termination of his service
and he is living on the mercy of his relatives. He further alleged that he
is suffering from various ailments and he has no money even for the
proper treatment of his ailments. It is pleaded by him that he tried to
get a job but despite his best efforts and running from pillar to post, he
has not been able to get any job and he remains unemployed. In the
circumstances the applicant has contended that some financial help
may be allowed to him so that he may survive otherwise he will die in
penury. An affidavit has been filed by the respondent no.1 in which he
stated that he has been unemployed since the date of his termination
and he does not have money for treatment of his ailments.

3.

An ex-parte award dated 16th November, 2004 was passed by

the Labour Court in favor of the respondent no.1 directing the petitioner
to reinstate with 50% back wages which order has since been stayed in
this petition. The Labor Court had held that the respondent no.1 was
an employee on the basis of the record of EPF and other record which
could not be refuted by the petitioner. An authority letter was filed after
CM No.6339/2007 in W.P(C) No.674/2006

Page 2 of 8

the service of notice on the petitioner but despite filing an authority
letter of authorized representative, no one had appeared and the Labor
Court had proceeded ex-parte against the petitioner.

4.

The petitioner has contested the application contending that an

ex-parte award was passed against the petitioner and from the record it
is clear that no notice was ever issued and served on the petitioner.
The petitioner denied that the applicant is out of job since the
termination of his service and since the time award has been passed in
his favor. It was denied that the applicant is passing through a bad
phase in his life and is living on the mercy of his relatives and financial
help from them. The petitioner has also contested the application on the
ground that there is no relationship of employer and employee between
the petitioner and respondent no.1 on the ground that the applicant
has himself stated that he was in employment of respondent no.2. It
has also been asserted that the application is filed with malafide
intention and with ulterior motives on false and baseless pleas.

5.

While considering an application under this provision it is

necessary to bear in mind that the spirit, intendment and object
underlying the statutory provision of Section 17B is to mitigate and
relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship resulting to a workman due to
delay in the implementation of an award directing reinstatement of his
services on account of the challenge made to it by the employer. The
CM No.6339/2007 in W.P(C) No.674/2006

Page 3 of 8

preliminary consideration for making available such a relief to a
workman is to be found in the benevolent purpose of the enactment. It
recognizes a workman’s right to a bare minimum to keep body and soul
together when a challenge has been made to an Award directing his
reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right of
assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way of
an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the employer
to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence allowance
which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a workman even if the
Award in favor of the workman is set aside by the High Court. In 1999
(2) SCC 106 (para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex
Court was of the view that the object under Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the
hardship that is caused to the workman due to the delay in
implementation of the Award.

6.

While considering an application under Section 17B of the

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 the Court cannot go into the merits of the
case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86 (2000) DLT 510=2000 (5)
AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander. Consequently whether
the Labor Court could proceed ex-parte against the petitioner or not, is
not be adjudicated at the stage of deciding this application under
section 17B of the Act. The Labor Court had held that the respondent
no.1 was an employee on the basis of the record of EPF and other
CM No.6339/2007 in W.P(C) No.674/2006

Page 4 of 8

record which could not be refuted by the petitioner. The petitioner has
contended that the applicant was working as a safai Karamchari at the
transit house. This however has not been denied that prior to the
agreement executed with the respondent no.2, the services were
provided by different contractors since 1985 when the transit house
was taken by the petitioner and the applicant had been working with
different contractors. The plea of the petitioner was not considered as
the petitioner was proceeded ex-party and prima facie there is
relationship of employer and employee in the facts and circumstances.
It was for the petitioner to prove that the applicant was an employee of
the respondent no.2 and the different contractors and the petitioner
had no control over him and the agreements with different contractors
were not sham documents. In absence of any evidence, it cannot be
held that there is no relationship of employer and employee so as to
deny the benefit under section 17 B of the Act. The statute requires
satisfaction of the following four conditions:
(i) an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed
in proceedings in a High Court or the Supreme Court;
(ii) during the pendency of such proceedings, employer is
required to pay full wages to the workman;
(iii) the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full wages
last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance
admissible to him under any Rule;
(iv) such wages would be admissible only if the workman
had not been employed in any establishment during such
period and an affidavit had been filed to such effect

The practice of disposal of the petition as well as the application
under Section 17B of the Act contemporaneously was deprecated by the
Apex Court and the High Court was directed to first expeditiously
dispose of the application under Section 17B by the Supreme Court by
its decision reported at VII (2000) SLT 70=JT 2000 (8) SC 501,
Workmen Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Hindustan
Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors.

Now how much would the respondent no.1/applicant will be

entitled for, whether he is entitled for last drawn wages or something
more. In the award dated 16th November, 2004, impugned by the
petitioner, the Labor Court had awarded 50% of the back wages with
reinstatement. The Apex Court in 1970 1 SCR 51 titled Town Municipal,
Athani v. P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. had held that a workman has a legal
right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot be
diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. The principles laid down by the Supreme Court
would have a bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well.
From a conspectus of the authoritative pronouncements of the Apex
Court, the right of a workman to an amount equivalent to the wages
notified under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact,
recognition of the constitutional mandate and nothing more. It is
undoubtedly, the bare minimum which is required by the workman to
subsist and is nothing more. Full wages last drawn can therefore only
CM No.6339/2007 in W.P(C) No.674/2006

Page 6 of 8

mean all the wages that have fallen due at least from the date of the
Award.

8.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred in the

application that he has been unemployed since the date of the award till
date. In the facts and circumstances for the forgoing reasons, the
applicant fulfills the criteria for availing the benefit under section 17B of
the act and if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes
Act, 1947 are satisfied, no order can be passed denying the workman
the benefit of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes Act, 1947.

9.

Consequently, the application of the workman/respondent no.1

under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed and
the petitioner is directed to pay the last drawn wages or minimum
wages whichever is higher from 16th November, 2004. Arrears of last
drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher be paid within
eight weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay last drawn wages or
minimum wages whichever is higher by the 15th of every English
Calendar month during the pendency of the writ petition. The
respondent No.1 is also directed to give an undertaking to the effect
that in case the writ petition is allowed, the difference in last drawn
wages and the minimum wages shall be repaid/refunded by the
respondent No.1 within the time as shall be permitted by this Court.
CM No.6339/2007 in W.P(C) No.674/2006

The undertaking be filed by the respondent No.1 within four weeks.
With these directions, the application is disposed of.

W.P.(C) No.674/2006
The learned counsel for the petitioner seeks time to file the
rejoinder. Rejoinder be filed within eight weeks.
