REKHA SHARMA, J.
The Air Hostesses in the employment of Indian Airlines are
supposed to maintain their body weight within limits prescribed in the
weight charts issued from time to time. The petitioners having busted
those charts have been grounded and have been told that till such
time they knock off the extra weight they will be treated on leave if
there is any to their credit or otherwise on ‘leave without pay’.

The

petitioners say that this order is unreasonable, unfair, without sanction
of law and allege that it is contrary to the Indian Airlines Employees
Service Regulations.

They also view it as an affront to their dignity,

honour and womanhood.
The respondent feels differently. It says that the job profile
of the Air Hostesses is such that it requires of them to maintain certain
standard of weight.

Keeping that in view their weight was made a

WP(C) Nos. 12875-83/06, 14443-44/06, 17318/06 & 1365/07

Page 2 of 11

condition of their appointment and the order issued are not only in
consonance with the terms of their appointment but have also been
necessitated to meet the challenges of a competitive market in the air
traffic business of which hospitality is an integral part.

As per the

Airlines the directions requiring the Air Hostesses to maintain body
weight standards have been in place since long and having been
accepted, any challenge to the same now is not only belated but
unwarranted.
Having provided a bird’s eye view of the issue involved let
me proceed with the details.
The petitioners have preferred four writ petitions.

Since a

common question has been raised in all the petitions, Writ Petition No.
12875-83 of 2006 filed by Ms. Sheila Joshi & others shall be treated as
the lead case.

The petitioners have been working as Cabin crew with

the Indian Airlines Ltd.

since 1982 in the Inflight Service Department

except petitioner in writ petition (C) No. 17318/06 who is working in
the Southern Region.

Initially they were offered appointments as

Trainee Air Hostesses on certain terms and conditions of which clauses
8 & 9 are important. They read as under :8.
While undergoing Training in the Indian
Airlines and the appointment as Air-Hostesses, you will
be governed by the Indian Airlines Service Regulations
applicable to the Flying Crew and Standing Orders
concerning discipline and appeals as framed/ amended
by Indian Airlines from time to time.
9. During the training period and on appointment
as Air Hostesses, your services are liable to be
terminated under the following circumstances
I) in the event of your getting married before the
specified period .
WP(C) Nos. 12875-83/06, 14443-44/06, 17318/06 & 1365/07

Page 3 of 11

II) If you (a) fail to maintain vision without Glasses
(b) do not maintain weight within the prescribed
limits
( c) develop air sickness.
The above offer of appointment, interalia, containing the
aforesaid terms and conditions was accepted by the Air Hostesses and
in token of their acceptance they appended their signatures thereon.
On successful completion of their training they were appointed on
regular basis and were issued fresh appointment letters.

Admittedly,

those appointment letters also contained the aforesaid terms and
conditions.

A sample copy of the appointment letter has been filed by

the Indian Airlines in WP(C) No. 1365/07 by Ms.

It was prepared with reference to age and

The Air Hostesses were supposed to adhere to the said chart

and keep their body weight within the minimum and the maximum
limit laid down therein.

It so happened that on November 4, 1987 the

Airlines issued a circular stating therein that the revised height and
weight chart was under preparation by the Chief Medical Officer and
that pending finalization of the same Cabin Crew should be subjected
to weight check twice a year.

It also provided that those who were

found exceeding the laid down standards upto 10% would be given a
letter to reduce their weight to standard weight within a specified
period and if after the expiry of that period the Cabin Crew failed to
come to the standard body weight he or she should be taken off flying

and treated on leave or leave without pay if no leave was due till she
or he attained the standard weight.

It further provided that in cases

where the excess weight was over 10% of the standard weight such
Cabin Crew should be taken off flight with immediate effect and given
a letter to reduce the standard weight by a specified period.

However, no order was issued

Thereafter, on December 25,1990 another Circular

was issued indicating the names of the Air Hostesses who were found
overweight.

In this circular also the name of petitioner Sheila Joshi

appeared and besides her, the names of petitioners Ms.
Chakrobarty and Kiran Choudhary also figured.

However, on June 6, 1996, a Circular was

issued stating that the cabin crew who were to be grounded due to

overweight by more than 10 kgs were to be treated on leave upto
the time

they reduce their weight according to the specified limits

and in case their leave stood exhausted they were to be treated on
leave without pay.

Later 10 kgs was brought down to 7 kgs by a

circular dated November 13/17, 1998, then to 5 kgs by circular dated
May 20, 1999, to 4 kgs by circular dated January 3, 2000, to 3 kgs by
circular dated October 31st 2000 and ultimately on May 4,2006 even
the allowance of 3 kgs was withdrawn and was made effective from
June 15,2006.

All cabin crew were advised to adhere to the height

and weight norm as laid down for them.

It is this circular of May

4,2006 which has been made the basis by the petitioners to approach
this court.
One thing which emerges from the above narration of facts
is that right from the day of their appointment, it was known to the
petitioners that they were to maintain body weight standards as laid
down by the Airlines from time to time.

It was made a condition of

their appointment and they had knowingly and willingly accepted the
same.

Therefore, this condition fructified into a consensual contract

between the parties.

True, in the past, this condition of their contract

was not enforced with all its rigour. Rather, one notices soft peddling
and in no case action in terms of the contract was ever taken. The
violators were simply grounded and were not paid their salaries if there
was no leave to their credit.
Should the petitioners make a grievance merely because
the concessions which they were enjoying have been withdrawn and

they have been asked to strictly adhere to the body weight chart in
keeping with their appointment letters?
The petitioners, in my view have no case.
appointment letter proves to be their nemesis.

Their

They agreed to the

terms contained therein. They are in the employment of the Airlines
from 1980-82.

They were being subjected to six-monthly height and

weight check.

The Circulars were being issued from time to time

asking the Cabin Crew to keep their weight within the prescribed limits
and if they were found in excess of the weight some of them at times
were grounded.

It is not for the first time on May 4, 2006 that they

were asked to comply with the weight chart.
now raise a grouse on that account.

Therefore, they cannot

Also, it is not for the first time

that they have been told that in case of grounding they will not be paid
their salaries in case there is no leave to their credit.

They were told

about this way back on November 4, 1987 when, as noticed above, a
Circular to that effect was issued.

They did not object to it then.

What new has happened now that they have come to the Court
seeking quashing of Circular of May 4, 2006 and also the direction that
they will not be paid their salary during the period of grounding if they
do not have leave to their credit?
It was stated that clause 9 of the Appointment Letter of the
petitioners provided that they were to be governed by the Indian
Airlines Flying Crew Service Regulations and as per Regulation No. 12
of the same members of the Flying Crew were to be retained in the
service of the company only if they remained medically fit for flying
duties.

It was thus sought to be contended that if a member of the

WP(C) Nos. 12875-83/06, 14443-44/06, 17318/06 & 1365/07

Page 7 of 11

Cabin Crew was found to be medically fit he or she could not be
grounded or deprive of his salary merely on account of being overweight.

It is not in dispute that the petitioners were found to be

medically fit.
It is true that Regulation No. 12 provided that a member of
the Cabin Crew was to be retained in service so long as he was
medically fit but equally true is the fact that the appointment letter
also provided that if they did not maintain the weight within the
prescribed limits their services were liable to be terminated.

This

clause in the appointment letter was in addition and not in derogation
to the clause that their appointment was to be governed by the Indian
Airlines Service Regulation.

In this view of the matter, the above said

Regulation does not wash away the terms of condition found in the
letter of appointment.

The petitioners may have been found to be

medically fit but the weight check which is undertaken bi-annually has
its genesis to the clause in the Appointment Letter .

Therefore, if the

weight is not found to be in accord with the required limit, the
consequences as laid down in the Appointment Letter flow.
It was contended by the learned counsel for the Indian
Airlines and in my view rightly that clause 9 of the Appointment Letter
of the petitioners empowered them to remove them from service in the
event of their not maintaining body weight as per the weight chart yet
it never took the extreme step of removing them from service.
Airlines, it is stated, was more than indulgent towards them.

The
They

were simply being warned from time to time to bring down their weight
and were also given time to do so.

It was stated that this “benevolent

Page 8 of 11

approach” was adopted to enable the defaulting members of the Cabin
Crew to comply with the norms. The Circulars which contained these
“benevolent measures” were agreed to and acted upon by the
members of the Cabin Crew.

As a matter of fact even as per the

impugned Circular of May 4, 2006 no action in terms of the
appointment letter has been taken nor does it indicate that any such
action is in contemplation.
of being

Hence, the action of grounding on account

over-weight and non-payment of salary in the event of no

leave to the credit of the Cabin Crew cannot be challenged at this
distant point of time apart from the fact that it was a condition of their
appointment and they had accepted it.
It was submitted on behalf of the petitioners that the Air
Corporation Act 1953 was repealed by the Air Corporation (Transfer of
Undertaking and Repeal) Act of 1994 and by virtue of Section 8 of the
repealing Act the employees of the Corporation as on the appointed
day were to continue to enjoy the same remuneration, same terms and
conditions and the same obligations as they enjoyed before coming
into force of the repeal of the Air Corporation Act.
Section 8,

On the strength of

it was argued that by virtue of the Circular issued on

November 4, 1987 the flying Crew enjoyed the grace of 10% of the
weight over and above the standard weight as laid down.

It was

sought to be contended that as after the Circular of November, 1987,
no revised weight chart was brought into existence till the repeal of the
Air Corporation Act of 1953, therefore, the grace of 10% continued to
remain in force even after the coming into force of the repealed Act
and in view of Section 8 of the said Act the same could not be
WP(C) Nos. 12875-83/06, 14443-44/06, 17318/06 & 1365/07

Page 9 of 11

withdrawn.

It was also argued that after the coming into force of the

Air Corporation ( Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act 1994 the
Airlines did not possess any power to issue Circulars with regard to
weight charts as that would have meant changing the terms and
conditions of service which in view of Section 8 of the repealed Act was
not permissible.
I need not go into the question whether the Air Corporation
Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal Act took away the powers of the
Airlines to issue Circulars because the argument proceeds on the basis
that Circulars issued prior thereto alone would hold the ground. If that
be so it is not understood how it is the Circular of November 1987
which will apply and not the revised chart which was issued in 1991.
In any case the petitioners were quiet so long as the grace of over
weight upto 10 kgs was allowed and even till date do not find fault with
those circulars which were issued after the repeal Act but now when no
grace at all is being given and it has been completely withdrawn they
are questioning the authority of the Airlines to issue the Circulars.
What does this mean?

It means that so long as it suited the

petitioners the Airlines had the authority to issue the Circulars and
when the weight chart is being strictly followed they are finding fault
with it.
Lastly it is not without rationale that the flying Crew has
been subjected to certain standards of height and weight.
profile demands it.

Their job

The aircrafts fly at a very high altitude.

Quite

often emergency situations arise because of air turbulence or on
account of aircraft developing snag.

The Cabin Crew including the Air

WP(C) Nos. 12875-83/06, 14443-44/06, 17318/06 & 1365/07

Page 10 of 11

Hostess are expected to handle the situation deftly, with alacrity and
presence of mind .

All this will be possible only if the Cabin Crew

possesses the highest order of physical and mental fitness.

And let us

not forget that in this era of cut throat competition no Airlines can
afford to remain lax in any department whatsoever, be it the
personality of its crew members, their physical fitness in all respects or
the air worthiness of the air craft or in relation to other facilities such
as catering etc.

If keeping in view this kind of job performance the Air

Hostesses are asked to battle their bulge, control their girth and keep
at desired level the affluence of their body weight as per the norms, it
is not understood how it is in any way unfair, unreasonable and
insulting to their womanhood. It is not the Air Hostesses alone which
are put to these rigours. The other Members of the flying crew are also
required to maintain a particular weight standard. If by preservance
the snails could reach the ark, why can’t these worthy ladies stand on
and turn the scale.
For the foregoing reasons, I find no merit in the writ
petitions, the same are dismissed but without burdening further with
costs.
