BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
1.

This criminal revision petition has been filed by Mr Baldev Raj

against an order of acquittal passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge on
06.07.2002, whereby the respondents have been acquitted of the offences under
Section 498A and 304 B IPC. The petitioner (Mr Baldev Raj) is the father of
the deceased Kavita, who died on 06.07.1993 as a result of a fall from the
fourth floor of her matrimonial home.

Late Kavita was married to the

respondent No.1 (Chander Prakash) on 02.02.1989.

CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

They had a girl child of

Page No.1 of 30

about 3-1/2 years of age at the time of Kavita's demise. The respondent Nos. 2,
3 and 4 are the brothers-in-law of late Kavita. The respondent No. 5 (Gulshan
Rani) is Kavita's mother-in-law. It is relevant to point out that no appeal was
preferred against the order of acquittal by the Government of NCT of Delhi.
Since the petitioner is aggrieved and he has no recourse to file an appeal, the
present criminal revision petition has been filed by him.

2.

The case against the respondents emanates from FIR No. 377/1993

registered at Police Station Paschim Vihar, under Sections 498A / 302B IPC.
The prosecution case was that late Kavita, daughter of the present petitioner
Baldev Raj and Smt. Varsha Rani, married Chander Prakash on 02.02.1989.
The couple started living together, firstly, at A-6, Pink Apartments and later at
A-45, Pink Apartments, Paschim Vihar, Delhi.

Late Smt. Kavita died an

unnatural death in the night intervening 5th and 6th July, 1993 at her
matrimonial house. The police had received information through an unknown
person with regard to the death of Smt. Kavita. The same was recorded in DD
No. 30-A at about 4.45 am on 06.07.1993. When the police officials arrived at
the scene of the incident, that is, house No. A-45, Pink Apartments, Paschim
Vihar, they found the body of late Smt. Kavita on a cot on the ground floor.
The parents of the deceased and the family members of her in-laws were also
present. The statements of the parents of late Smt. Kavita, namely, Smt. Varsha
Rani and Mr Baldev Raj (the petitioner herein) were recorded by the SubCRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.2 of 30

Divisional Magistrate. The statement of Smt. Varsha Rani was treated as the
complaint and the SDM directed the Station House Officer of Police Station
Paschim Vihar to register the case and investigate the matter.

3.

As per the statement of Smt. Varsha Rani, recorded by the SDM,

Kavita and Chander Prakash, after their marriage on 02.02.1989, lived at A-6,
Pink Apartments for about 1-1/2 years. Thereafter, they shifted to A-45, Pink
Apartments, Paschim Vihar along with other family members of Chander
Prakash. It was alleged that Kavita and Chander Prakash used to quarrel /
dispute on account of domestic matters. It was also alleged that Chander
Prakash used to consume liquor and then used to beat Kavita.

It was also

stated that about 15 days prior to the making of the statement before the SDM,
Chander Prakash had beaten Kavita and she (Kavita) had come to her parents'
house at B-3/279, Paschim Vihar. It was stated that Smt. Varsha Rani and
Baldev Raj pacified her and after one day Kavita returned to her matrimonial
home.

At about 4 am on 06.07.1993, Smt. Varsha Rani and Baldev Raj

received information that Kavita had jumped from the house and had died.
Both Smt. Varsha Rani and Baldev Raj rushed to the house of Chander Prakash
and found that Kavita was lying dead. There, they came to know from the
people that on the previous night also, Chander Prakash had quarreled with
Kavita and had beaten her and at that time his three brothers and mother were
present in the house. It was also stated before the SDM by Smt. Varsha Rani
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.3 of 30

that Chander Prakash used to tell Kavita's parents that other people got lots of
things in their marriages but what had her parents given in her marriage. It was
stated by Smt. Varsha Rani that her daughter Kavita died due to the taunts and
harassment. Sh. Baldev Raj also made a statement before the SDM which was
more or less identical to the statement given by his wife Smt. Varsha Rani.

4.

On the conduct of the post mortem on Kavita's body, six external

injuries comprising of abrasions and fractures were noted. The opinion of the
doctor conducting the post mortem was that all the injuries were ante mortem
and were caused by blunt force impact as a result of a fall from a height. The
death was due to shock and haemorrhage consequent to injuries.

5.

It was also the case of the prosecution that in the evening of

06.07.1993 Ms Amita, sister of the deceased Kavita, and Sh. Ashok Dandona,
uncle of the deceased Kavita, visited the office of the SDM and made their
statements. In those statements allegations of demand of dowry and harassment
to Kavita on account of such demands were made. As per the prosecution Sh.
Baldev Raj, appeared once more before the SDM on 09.07.1993 and made
another statement to allege instances of demand of dowry and harassment to
Kavita on that account.

CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.4 of 30

6.

After completion of investigations and filing of the charge-sheet,

the Court framed charges on 05.01.1994 against the respondents, who were all
accused, for committing offences under Section 498-A and 304 B IPC.

The

prosecution examined 20 witnesses. However, the relevant witnesses are PWs
1-3 and PW5. PW1 Smt. Varsha Rani and PW2 Baldev Raj are the parents of
the deceased Kavita. PW3, Sh. Ashok Dandona is the uncle of the deceased.
PW5 Ms Amita, Kavita's sister, during her deposition was declared hostile and
was thereafter cross-examined by the prosecution. This is a very relevant and
important circumstance. Another fact that is of great significance is that PW5
Amita married the accused / respondent No.1 Chander Prakash on 08.11.1994,
during the pendency of the trial. It is indeed an unusual circumstance that the
sister of a deceased has married her sister's widower, when there is a criminal
case pending against him with regard to cruelty, harassment and commission of
a dowry death in respect of her sister. It appears that the factum of such a
marriage between Ms Amita and Chander Prakash has gone a long way in
persuading the learned Additional Sessions Judge to return a finding of
acquittal in favour of the accused / respondents.

7.

After examining the evidence in detail and in particular the

evidence led by PW1, PW2, PW3 and PW5, the learned Additional Sessions
Judge came to the conclusion that the prosecution has not been able to establish
the case either under Section 304 B or Section 498-A IPC. Accordingly, they
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.5 of 30

were all granted the benefit of doubt and, although the exact cause of the
unnatural death of Kavita had not come on record, all the respondents were
acquitted for the offences under Section 498-A and Section 304 B IPC.

8.

Mr Thakur, who appeared on behalf of the petitioner, submitted

that this was a fit case in which this Court ought to interfere in revision against
an acquittal. He submitted that even if the Court had found that a case under
Section 304 B IPC had not been made out, it could very well, on the basis of
evidence on record, convict the accused under Section 306 IPC for abetment to
commit suicide read with Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 as
also under Section 498A IPC. He submitted that there was enough material on
record to suggest that Kavita “jumped” of the roof of the fourth floor of her
matrimonial home. Therefore, it was a clear case of suicide. That being the
position, the presumption under Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act,
1872 ought to have been drawn by the court concerned. He also submitted that
since cruelty was established, the respondents ought to have been found guilty
under Section 498 A IPC. In support of his contentions, Mr Thakur relied upon
the following decisions:(i)

Devinder Singh & Ors. v. State of Punjab: 2005 (3) JCC 1725
(SC);

(ii)

Shamnsaheb M. Multtani v. State of Karnataka: 2001 Crl. L. J.

9.

Mr Thakur submitted that he was well aware of the limited and

restricted powers that this Court possessed in entertaining an application by a
private party seeking revision of an order of acquittal. He submitted that under
Section 401 (3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it is clear that in
exceptional circumstances, though the court cannot convert an acquittal into a
conviction, it can remit the matter for re-trial. He submits that the present case
falls within the parameters prescribed for exercise of such revisional
jurisdiction. To explain the extent of the powers exercisable by this Court, he
referred to the following decisions of the Supreme Court:(i)

Vimal Singh v. Khuman Singh and Another: 1998 SCC (Cri)
1574;

(ii)

K. Chinnaswamy Reddy v. State of Andhra pradesh and

10.

Mr Thakur submitted that the cruelty that is requisite under Section

498A IPC is clearly made out. He referred to the deposition of PW1 (Smt.
Varsha Rani) where she has stated that sometime after the marriage, accused
Chander Prakash started quarreling with Kavita on minor domestic issues and
he also used to give her beatings.

With reference to the other accused, PW1

has stated:“All of them used to taunt my daughter for insufficient
dowry and on the quality of goods given.”
And further:“My daughter used to tell me that all the accused used to
give her beatings. I used to make my daughter understand
and send her back to her matrimonial home. I had tried to
make the accused understand with folded hands but they did
not listen to me.”
In examination-in-chief, Smt. Varsha Rani further stated:“About 15 days before her death Chander Prakash and his
brothers had given beatings to my daughter and she came to
our house in a rickshaw when I saw that she was bleeding
from her mouth and her lips were swollen. She came to our
house at about 11.30 pm.”
In the course of cross-examination also PW1 (Smt. Varsha Rani) had stated:“Chander Prakash used to take liquor. There used to be
some quarrel between Chander Prakash and Kavita on
account of his taking liquor. There were also quarrel about
some petty household matters. It is incorrect to suggest that
none of the accused had given any beatings to the deceased
or that Kavita had accidentally fallen from the roof top.”

CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.8 of 30

Referring to the deposition of PW2 Sh. Baldev Raj, Mr Thakur submitted that
he had also made similar statements with regard to cruelty. In his examinationin-chief PW2 had, inter alia, stated:“About 15 days before her death, my daughter Kavita had
come to our house at about 11.30 pm because accused
Gulshan Rani had quarrelled with them on some petty
matter and all the four other accused persons ha mercilessly
given beating to Kavita. I did not sent my daughter back. I
along with my wife went to the house of Bua of Chander
Prakash. She told us that she will make the accused
understand, and on her asking, I sent my daughter back on
the next day.”
He continued his deposition as under:“On the night of 3rd July 1993, accused had again given
beatings to my daughter, and she had come to my house.
She told me weeping that she had been given beatings by all
the accused persons and the accused had also threatened to
kill her.”
PW3 Sh. Ashok Dandona, who is the uncle of the deceased Kavita stated in
examination-in-chief as under:“Kavita used to tell me on telephone and sometimes she
used to talk to my wife on telephone and she used to
complain that she was being given third-degree torture for
brining less dowry. All the three brothers of Chander
Prakash and his mother also used to join in this torture.”
As regards the deceased Kavita's sister PW5 Amita, Mr Thakur submitted that
she had been declared hostile by the prosecution. He surmised that possibly her
change in attitude was because she subsequently got married to Chander
Prakash. However, he submitted that there was sufficient material on the basis

CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.9 of 30

of the evidence led by the prosecution to indicate that there was cruelty meted
out by the accused.

11.

Mr R. K. Naseem, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

respondents, submitted that while deciding this revision petition, this Court
must take into account three important features, which go to the root of the
case. The first feature being that the accused have been subjected to a fullfledged trial and that the petitioner participated with full force in the said trial.
The second feature is that the order of acquittal has been passed on merits after
considering the entire evidence on record. The learned Additional Sessions
Judge has, after examining the evidence placed before him by the prosecution,
disbelieved the prosecution case. Thirdly, the State has chosen not to file any
appeal against the order of acquittal. Mr Naseem submitted that the parameters
of exercise of jurisdiction by the High Court under Sections 397/ 401 of the
Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 are well settled. Interference in acquittal
cases is an extremely rare phenomenon.

In any event, re-appreciation of

evidence is not permissible in a revision petition. For this proposition, he
placed reliance on the Supreme Court decision in the case of Thankappan
Nadar & Others v. Gopala Krishnan & Another: 2002(4) Crimes 36 (SC).

12.

Referring to paragraph 34 of the impugned judgment, Mr Naseem

submitted that the Court came to the conclusion that there was no specific
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.10 of 30

demands for dowry mentioned in the initial statements made by Smt. Varsha
Rani PW1 and Sh. Baldev Raj PW2 before the SDM . From those initial
statements, it was only apparent that there was some dispute between the
deceased Kavita and her husband Chander Prakash on domestic matters and
that Chander Prakash used to beat Kavita sometimes under the influence of
liquor. He submitted that as observed in the impugned order in paragraph 36
thereof, the allegations made by PW1 and PW2 in their statements before the
Court were missing from their previously recorded true statements. In other
words, Mr Naseem submitted, the learned Additional Sessions Judge regarded
the statements made in Court as improvements upon the original truthful
statements made by PW1 and PW2 before the SDM.

13.

He further submitted that, with regard to the statements made by

PW1 and PW2 before the SDM and the fact that such statements had been
admitted to be true before the Court, this indicates that the disputes between
Chander Prakash and Kavita were on account of petty domestic matters or
because Chander Prakash used to beat her under the influence of liquor. The
learned Additional Sessions Judge came to the conclusion that the disputes
were not with regard to demand of dowry. It is on the basis of appreciation of
the aforesaid evidence that the learned Additional Sessions Judge came to the
conclusion:-

CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.11 of 30

“There is nothing on record to show that the accused had
made demand of dowry and on that account, they forced
Kavita to commit suicide.”
Mr Naseem also submitted that it has come in evidence that the present
petitioner Sh. Baldev Raj (PW2) was the eldest of four brothers. It is also true
that PW2 Baldev Raj separated from the family and started living separately
about 25 years back. The other three brothers which include PW3 Ashok
Dandona resided together as a part of a joint family. Therefore, it is on the
basis of this that the learned Additional Sessions Judge concluded in paragraph
38 of the impugned judgment that:“Thus it has come on the record that Baldev Raj and his
family were living separately from the rest of the brothers.”
According to Mr Naseem, this is an extremely important circumstance
inasmuch as PW3 was living separately and, therefore, would not be in the
knowledge of the affairs of Kavita, who was the daughter of PW1 and PW2.
Furthermore, Mr Naseem pointed out that the statements of PW3 have not been
corroborated by PWs 1 and 2. The finding of the learned Additional Sessions
Judge to this effect is in paragraph 39 of the impugned judgment which, inter
alia, reads as under:“Hence, the statement of PW3 as recorded in the office of
the SDM cannot be given much importance. Moreover, it
has come in the cross-examination of PW3 that he had told
Shri Baldev Raj about the visits of Kavita to his house and
her disclosure to him and his wife that accused persons used
to beat her on account of demand of dowry. However, such
facts are missing from the statements of PW1 and PW2.
They have not told that PW3 ever told them about the
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.12 of 30

alleged visits of Kavita to his house and disclosure of
incriminating facts to PW3 and his wife. Hence, it is
difficult to believe that Kavita would visit the house of PW3
to tell him the facts which she did not prefer to disclose to
her mother and father. It is highly improbable particularly
because the family of Baldev Raj was living separately from
the rest of the brothers from the last 25 years. The
prosecution cannot establish its case on the basis of the
statements of PW3.”
It is apparent that the learned Additional Sessions Judge did not give much
credence, if at all, to the statements of PW3 made either before the SDM or
before Court. Mr Naseem also referred to other findings recorded by the
learned Additional Sessions Judge to indicate that the trial court considered the
matter in detail and found that Section 498A IPC was not made out and that the
question of Kavita being driven to commit suicide was also considered and
therefore, it cannot be said that the trial court was unmindful of the provisions
of Section 306 IPC. The findings are as under:“45.
From the discussion of the facts as observed in
the earlier part of the order, I find that the prosecution has
failed to establish that accused Chander Prakash and his
family members caused cruelty or harassment to Kavita. As
per the statements of PW1 and PW2, the dispute between
the husband and the wife was on account of petty domestic
matter or at the most, Chander Prakash used to beat her
under the influence of liquor. There was no demand of
dowry. Such allegations do not constitute the offence as
described under Section 498A of the IPC. The alleged
beating etc. was on small matters and it cannot be said that
such allegation could have driven Kavita to commit suicide.
The allegations of PW1 and PW2 that in the night of the
incident, Chander Prakash and another accused persons had
beaten Kavita are only their presumption. No evidence has
been brought on record in that regard.”
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.13 of 30

14.

Replying to the submissions made with respect to the invocation of

provisions of Section 306 IPC read with Section 113 A of the Indian Evidence
Act, 1872, Mr Naseem said that the question of abetment and the raising of a
presumption of abetment would only arise if it was established as a fact that
Kavita had committed suicide. The question of whether she had committed
suicide or not, cannot be determined conclusively and this the trial court had
clearly observed in the operative portion of the order itself by stating that the
exact cause of the unnatural death of Kavita had not come on record.

15.

Mr Naseem also referred to Ex.PW12/B which are the brief facts in

the inquest report prepared by the SDM, which indicate:“............. One Smt. Kavita W/o Sh. Chander Prakash died
due to alleged fall from roof top of her in-laws house at A45, Pink Apartments, Paschim Vihar, Delhi”
He also referred to Ex.PW12/C which is the inquest form. Serial No.12 of the
form carries the following question:“ In what manner or by what weapon or instrument such
marks of injuries of violence appeared to have been
committed?
As against this, the answer given is :“Alleged fall from roof at the height of 47 feet app. and
intercepted in between by telephone wire at a height of 15
feet app.”

CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.14 of 30

In the request for post mortem (Ex.PW12/D), inter alia, the following questions
were also posed:“(iii)

Whether death is due to fall (this has been stated by the
members of husband family).”

“(v)

If death is due to fall, then the height from which she fell
down may be indicated.”

PW18 (Dr. L. T. Ramani) (Dy. M. S. LNJP Hospital) stated in his deposition
that:“In my opinion, all injuries were ante-mortem caused by blunt
force impact as a result of fall from height as alleged. Death was
due to shock and haemorrhage consequent to injury.”
Taking into account the aforesaid, Mr Naseem submitted that there is no
concrete or specific proof that this was a case of suicide.

Unless and until

suicide is established, the provisions of Section 306 IPC do not come into play.
For this proposition, Mr Naseem relied upon the decision of the Supreme Court
in the case of Wazir Chand and Another v. State of Haryana: (1989) 1 SCC
244.

16.

It is contended by Mr Naseem that once the cause of death becomes

uncertain and it cannot be said that Kavita committed suicide, the entire
prosecution case shrinks down to one of domestic bickering and occasional
beating by the husband after consuming liquor. He submitted that, therefore,
the only point for consideration would be whether the case falls within
Explanation (a) in Section 498A IPC. The said Explanation (a) makes it clear
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.15 of 30

that cruelty means any willful conduct which is of such a nature as is likely to
drive the woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life,
limb or health (whether mental or physical) of the woman. He submitted that
Explanation (b) would not come into play as there is no demand for any
property or valuable security. In the context of the provisions of Section 498A
read in the light of Explanation (a) thereto, Mr Naseem submitted that the
allegations as brought forth

in the statements of PW1 and PW2, do not

constitute an offence under Section 498A IPC. He referred to the decision of a
learned Single Judge of the Bombay High Court in the case of Smt. Sarla
Prabhakar Waghmare v. State of Maharashtra and others: 1990 CRL. L. J.
407. He submitted that in this decision it was held that it was not every
harassment or every type of cruelty that would attract Section 498A IPC. It
must be established that the beating and harassment was with a view to force
the woman to commit suicide or to fulfill illegal demands of the husband and
in-laws. Therefore, according to Mr Naseem, even if the allegations of beating
were taken to be true, it would not in itself amount to cruelty of the type
mentioned in Section 498A IPC.

17.

A reference was also made to a decision of a learned Single Judge

of the Punjab and Haryana High Court in the case of Richhpal Kaur v. The
State of Haryana and another: 1991(2) RCR 53 (P&H). In the said decision it
was held that the motive for causing injuries to the wife was her refusal to help
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.16 of 30

her in-laws and her husband in effecting a compromise in some other criminal
case. The beating and the act of cruelty was not with the intention to force the
wife to bring more dowry and to meet any unlawful demand. Therefore, the
Court came to the conclusion that the offence under Section 498A IPC was not
made out.

Concluding his arguments, Mr Naseem submitted that it is,

therefore, clear that every instance of beating does not amount to an offence
under Section 498A IPC. He submitted that since, admittedly, this was not a
case of a dowry death under Section 304B IPC as there was no evidence of any
demand for dowry, even Explanation (b) to Section 498A IPC could not be
invoked. Explanation (a) to Section 498A IPC was also not attracted in the
present case because the cruelty, if at all, was not of such a nature as was likely
to drive Kavita to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to her life,
limb or health (whether mental or physical).

It was, therefore, contended by

him that Section 498A IPC was not at all attracted. Furthermore, Section 306
IPC as also Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 also did not come
into play, according to him, because the trial Court was of the clear view that
the cause of death of Kavita was indeterminate. While it was an unnatural
death, it could not be ascertained as to whether she had committed suicide or it
was an accident. In the absence of a clear finding as a matter of fact that Kavita
had committed suicide, there would be no question of invoking the proceedings
of Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and Section 306 IPC.

CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

18.

Mr Thakur, in rejoinder, submitted that according to him the death

of Kavita was a clear case of suicide. He submitted that at various portions of
the evidence as also the Section 313 Cr. P. C. statement of Chander Prakash, it
has come on record that Kavita had jumped. According to Mr Thakur, if this
were to be the case then clearly Kavita committed suicide. He also submitted
that PW2 Baldev Raj had stated in his deposition that Kavita was beaten up and
was also threatened to be killed three days prior to her death. This, according to
him, amounted to cruelty envisaged under Section 498A IPC. He referred to
the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Sabehrao and another v.
State of Maharashtra: 2006 (2) JCC 871 to buttress his submission that cruelty
could even be mental torture and need not necessarily have physical
manifestations.

19.

I have set down in detail the arguments of the counsel for the

parties to indicate clearly the extent of the interference called for by the
petitioner and non-interference sought by the respondents. In order to arrive at
a decision, firstly, it would be appropriate if the exact scope and width of a
criminal revision petition on behalf of a private party against an order of
acquittal is examined. Thereafter, I shall examine the decisions referred to by
Mr Thakur in support of his contention that at least a case under Section 306
IPC read with Section 113-A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and under
Section 498A IPC was made out.

One of the earliest decisions of the Supreme Court with respect to

the powers of revision of a High Court is that of D. Stephens (supra). With
reference to Section 439 of the Criminal Procedure Code of 1898 (which is
similar to Section 401 of the 1973 Code) the Supreme Court observed as
under:“10.
The revisional jurisdiction conferred on the
H.C. under section 439, Criminal P. C., is not to be lightly
exercised when it is invoked by a private complainant
against an order of acquittal, against which the Govt. has a
right of appeal under section 417. It could be exercised only
in exceptional cases where the interests of public justice
require interference for the correction of a manifest
illegality, or the prevention of a gross miscarriage of justice.
This jurisdiction is not ordinarily invoked or used merely
because the lower Ct. has taken a wrong view of the law or
misappreciated the evidence on record.”
This was followed by another decision of the Supreme Court in the case of K.
Chinnaswamy Reddy (supra), which is often cited as a leading case.

The

Supreme Court held as under:“ It is true that it is open to a High Court in revision to set
aside an order of acquittal even at the instance of private
parties, though the State may not have though fit to appeal;
but this jurisdiction should in our opinion be exercised by
the High Court only in exceptional cases, when there is
some glaring defect in the procedure or there is a manifest
error on a point of law and consequently there has been a
flagrant miscarriage of justice. Sub-section (4) of S. 439
forbids a High Court from converting a finding of acquittal
into one of conviction and that makes it all the more
incumbent on the High Court to see that it does not convert
the finding of acquittal into one of conviction by the
indirect method of ordering retrial, when it cannot itself
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.19 of 30

directly convert a finding of acquittal into a finding of
conviction. This places limitations on the power of the High
Court to set aside a finding of acquittal in revision and it is
only in exceptional cases that this power should be
exercised. It is not possible to lay down the criteria for
determining such exceptional cases which would cover all
contingencies. We may however indicate some cases of this
kind, which would in our opinion justify the High Court in
interfering with a finding of acquittal in revision. These
cases may be : where the trial court has no jurisdiction to try
the case but has still acquitted the accused, or where the
trial court has wrongly shut out evidence which the
prosecution wished of produce, or where the appeal court
has wrongly held evidence which was admitted by the trial
court to be inadmissible, or where material evidence has
been overlooked either by the trial court or by the appeal
court, or where the acquittal is based on a compounding of
the offence, which is invalid under the law. These and
other cases of similar nature can properly be held to be
cases of exceptional nature, where the High Court can
justifiably interfere with an order of acquittal; and in such a
case it is obvious that it cannot be said that the High Court
was doing indirectly what it could not do directly in view of
the provisions of S. 439(4). We have therefore to see
whether the order of the High Court setting aside the order
of acquittal in this case can be upheld on these principles.”
In Dhirendra Nath Mitra and Anr. v. Mukanda Lal Sen: AIR 1955 SC 584,
the Supreme Court cautioned:“Now it may well be that a different view of this evidence
could have been taken but that is not enough to justify
interference in revision when there is an application by a
private party to set aside an order of acquittal.”
In Mahendra Pratap Singh v. Sarju Singh: (1968) 2 SCR 287, the Supreme
Court, following K. Chinnaswamy Reddy (supra) observed that an interference
in revision with an order of acquittal can only take place if there is a glaring

CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.20 of 30

defect of procedure in the instances as pointed out in K. Chinnaswamy Reddy
(supra). The Supreme Court also observed that although the list given in K.
Chinnaswamy Reddy (supra) was not exhaustive of all the circumstances in
which the High Court may interfere in an acquittal in a revision “it is obvious
that the defect in the judgment under revision must be analogous to those
actually indicated by this Court.”

In Ramu v. Jagannath: 1995 SCC (Cri)

181, the Supreme Court reiterated that the revisional jurisdiction conferred on
the High Court should not be lightly exercised particularly when it has been
invoked upon a private complaint. In Vimal Singh (supra), the Supreme Court
observed that with regard to Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure,
1973, the High Court does not exercise its revisional power ordinarily to
interfere with judgments of acquittal passed by the trial court unless there has
been manifest error of law or procedure. The Supreme Court held:“The interference with the order of acquittal passed by the
trial court is limited only to exceptional cases when it is
found that the order under revision suffers from glaring
illegality or has caused miscarriage of justice or when it is
found that the trial court has no jurisdiction to try the case
where the trial court has illegally shut out the evidence
which otherwise ought to have been considered or where
the material evidence which clinches the issue have been
overlooked. These are the instances where the High Court
would be justified in interfering with the order of acquittal.
Sub-section (3) of Section 401 mandates that the High
Court shall not convert a finding of acquittal into one of
conviction. Thus, the High Court would not be justified in
substituting an order of acquittal into one of conviction even
if it is convinced that the accused deserves conviction.”

CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.21 of 30

The Supreme Court further cautioned against the reappreciation of evidence by
the High Court in exercise of its revisional power by holding:“In fact, the High Court has entered into the domain of
reappreciation of evidence which it was not authorized to
do in exercise of its revisional power.”
The same views have been reiterated by various decisions of the Supreme
Court from time to time. In Hydru v. State of Kerala: (2004) 13 SCC 374,
Supreme Court observed as under:“It is well settled that in revision against acquittal by a
private party, the powers of the Revisional Court are very
limited. It can interfere only if there is any procedural
irregularity or material evidence has been overlooked or
misread by the subordinate court. If upon reappreciation of
evidence, two views are possible, it is not permissible even
for the appellate court in appeal against acquittal to interfere
with the same, much less in revision where the powers are
much narrower.”
The reference to the various decisions of the Supreme Court on the scope and
ambit of powers of the High Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction
under Section 401 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 clearly reveals that
the powers are very limited. The revisional Court does not function as a court
of appeal and cannot reappraise evidence.

It cannot also interfere with an

order of acquittal unless it is an exceptional case of some procedural
irregularity or overlooking of material evidence or misreading of the same,
which is manifest and which results in a flagrant miscarriage of justice. With
these parameters in mind, let me now examine the decisions cited by Mr
Thakur.

It is clear that the trial court has on appreciation of evidence held

that there was no demand for dowry. That being the case, the question of
Section 304B IPC does not arise at all. Moreover, invocation of Explanation
(b) of Section 498A IPC also does not arise. The issue that remains to be
considered is whether the trial court ought to have considered convicting the
respondents under Section 306 IPC after raising the presumption under Section
113-A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. The question is also whether the trial
court ought not to have found the respondents guilty under Section 498A IPC in
the context of cruelty as explained in Explanation (a) thereof. The Supreme
Court decision in Devinder Singh (supra) pertains to the offence under Section
304B IPC and since the finding has already been recorded that there was no
dowry related demand in the present case, the said decision would not be of any
relevance. In Shamnsaheb M. Multtani (supra), the Supreme Court noted the
difference in the legal position between the offence under Section 304-B and
Section 306 IPC, which was earlier merely an offence of abetment of suicide.
The Court observed that by the introduction of Section 113-A in the Evidence
Act the said offence under Section 306 IPC had acquired wider dimensions and
had become a serious marriage-related offence. According to the Supreme
Court, Section 113-A of the Evidence Act provided that under certain
conditions, almost similar to the conditions of dowry death, the Court “may
presume” having regard to the circumstances of the case that such suicide had
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.23 of 30

been abetted by her husband. The Supreme Court observed that when the law
provides that the Court “may presume” a fact, it was discretionary on the part of
the court either to regard such fact as proved or not to do so and it depended
upon all the other circumstances of the case. There was no compulsion on the
Court to act on the presumption and, therefore, the accused could persuade the
Court against drawing a presumption adverse to him. It must be pointed out
that the case of Shamnsaheb M. Multtani (supra) was one under Section 304 B
and not under Section 306 IPC. The reference to Section 306 IPC and Section
113-A of the Evidence Act was made to bring out the distinction between the
presumption which has mandatorily to be drawn under Section 113-B of the
Indian Evidence Act, 1872 in respect of an offence under Section 304 B IPC
and the presumption that may, in the discretion of the Court, be drawn under
Section 113 A of the Evidence Act in respect of an offence under Section 306
IPC. The said decision is limited to that and would, therefore, be of no help to
the petitioner.

22.

The next decision relied upon by Mr Thakur was that of K. Prema

S. Rao(supra). In that case, the charge had been framed for an offence under
Section 304 B IPC and Section 498A IPC. However, the Supreme Court held
that even though the charge had been framed under the aforesaid sections, if the
evidence was sufficient, the husband could be convicted under Section 306 IPC
for abetment of suicide of his wife. The Supreme Court held that the acquittal
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.24 of 30

of the husband of the offence under Section 304 B IPC was correct in the
absence of any demand of dowry but the willful conduct of the husband forcing
the wife to part with her stridhan and for that purpose concealing her postal
mails was so cruel that she was driven to commit suicide and, therefore, a clear
case of conviction under Section 306 IPC was made out. The Supreme Court
also observed that mere omission on the part of the trial court to mention
Section 306 IPC at the time of framing of charges did not preclude a court from
convicting the accused for the said offence when found proved. It was in the
alternate charge framed under Section 498A IPC, that it had been clearly
mentioned that the accused subjected the deceased to such cruelty and
harassment so as to drive her to commit suicide. The Supreme Court held that
the provisions of Section 221 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of 1973 were
sufficient to enable a criminal court to convict an accused for an offence with
which he was not charged, although on facts found in the evidence, he could
have been charged for such offences. The Court also held in the facts of the
case that the omission to frame a charge under Section 306 IPC had not
resulted in any failure of justice and, therefore, Section 215 of the Code of
Criminal Procedure, 1973 permitted the trial to ignore any error committed at
the time of framing of the charge.

23.

There is no dispute with the aforesaid proposition. But it must be

noted that the decision of the Supreme Court was rendered in the factual
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.25 of 30

backdrop of that case. There was a finding in that case that the cruel conduct of
the husband led the wife to commit suicide. As noted in paragraph 19 of the
said decision, the courts below had found the husband guilty of cruel treatment
of his wife “and as a result the wife committed suicide within seven years of
their marriage.” It is on the basis of this finding that the Supreme Court held
that on such evidence the presumption which arises under Section 113A of the
Evidence Act was that the husband abetted the suicide. It is, therefore, clear
that the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of K. Prema S. Rao(supra)
was rendered on the basis of the findings: (a) the husband was guilty of cruel
treatment of his wife and (b) as a result of which the wife committed suicide.
In the present case, the question of Kavita committing suicide is indeterminate.
The trial court has not returned a finding as to whether the unnatural death of
Kavita was on account of her committing suicide or was an accident. It has not
returned a definite finding not because it ignored or failed to return any such
finding but because it found that there was not enough evidence on record to
return a definite finding with regard to the cause of death. Therefore, in the
absence of a definite conclusion that Kavita did commit suicide, the
presumption under Section 113-A of the Evidence Act cannot be pressed into
service nor can the provisions of Section 306 IPC be attracted. The decision in
K. Prema S. Rao(supra) would, therefore, also not be of any assistance to the
petitioner.

24.

In Hira Lal (supra), which was also a decision of the Supreme

Court relied upon by Mr Thakur, although the Court found that conviction
under Section 304 B IPC could not be sustained, there was sufficient material
to convict the accused in terms of Section 306 IPC along with Section 498A
IPC. The Supreme Court had placed reliance on its earlier decision in the case
of K. Prema S. Rao(supra) but that case, too, was a case of a clear cut suicide.
Paragraph 3 of the said decision indicates that “One Sarita committed suicide
by consuming poison on 14.04.1999.” Therefore, just as the decision in K.
Prema S. Rao(supra) was of no help to the petitioner, this decision in the case
of Hira Lal (supra) would also not advance the petitioner's case. The cases of
Gurbachan Singh (supra) and Naresh Kumar (supra) were also clear-cut
cases of suicide and, therefore, the provisions of Section 306 IPC were held to
apply. Those cases also do not help the case of the petitioner because, as
rightly pointed out by Mr Naseem, unless and until it can be determined that
Kavita committed suicide, the question of invoking Section 306 IPC or Section
113-A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 would not at all arise. For an offence
under Section 306 IPC, as pointed out by the Supreme Court in the case of
Wazir Chand (supra), “before a person can be convicted of abetting the
suicide of any other person, it must be established that such other person
committed suicide.” Therefore, the commission of suicide is a pre-condition
for invoking the offence of abetment of suicide or for raising the presumption
under Section 113 A of the Evidence Act.

This leaves only the issue with regard to the applicability of

Explanation (a) of Section 498-A IPC. The learned Additional Sessions Judge
had, upon an examination of the entire evidence on record, come to the
conclusion that the accused cannot be found guilty of having committed the
offence under Section 498-A IPC. The learned Additional Sessions Judge
noted all the circumstances including the circumstance of occasional beating
being meted out by Chander Prakash to Kavita. Despite this, the learned
Additional Sessions Judge has rejected the prosecution case. If this Court were
to take a contrary view, it would amount to reappreciation of the evidence and
that is not permissible as already indicated above.

26.

Before parting with this decision, it must be pointed out that the

circumstance that PW5 Amita, deceased Kavita's sister, married the accused
Chander Prakash is also a very important circumstance in finding a key to this
case.

As observed in this judgment earlier, it is apparent that the trial court

was greatly influenced by this fact. Although PW5 Amita was declared as a
hostile witness, it does not mean that her entire testimony ought to be discarded
if it otherwise has a ring of truth. The learned Additional Sessions Judge has
recorded in the impugned judgment that in her cross-examination PW5 Amita
had stated that her father (Baldev Raj) did not want to take action against the
accused persons as he did not have any complaint against them but that he was
CRL. REV. P. 695/2002

Page No.28 of 30

pressurized by his brothers to file a complaint. It was further stated that after
PW2 Baldev Raj had made his initial statement before the SDM, his brothers
obtained copies of the statements of both PW1 and PW2 and the same were
taken along with PW5 to an advocate and the statements were shown. The
advocate told them that on the basis of such statements action could not be
taken against the in-laws of Kavita. PW5 Amita further stated that the advocate
told them that unless there were allegations of harassment and beating on
account of dowry, no case could be made out.

She stated that she was

pressurized to make a false statement before the SDM. The learned Additional
Sessions Judge also noted that it must be kept in mind that PW5 Amita
subsequently married Chander Prakash on 08.11.1994 during the pendency of
the proceedings of the trial in the present case.

In this context, the learned

Additional Sessions Judge observed:“If the accused persons would have caused harassment or
cruelty to Kavita then it is difficult to believe that PW5
would have married with accused Chander Prakash.”
This observation, I believe, sums up the entire thinking of the learned
Additional Sessions Judge. I have already indicated that any interference with
the impugned judgment would amount to a reappreciation of evidence. In any
event, I have also indicated that the present case is not such an exceptional case
as indicated by the various decisions of the Supreme Court where this Court
would be within its powers under Section 401 of the Code of Criminal
