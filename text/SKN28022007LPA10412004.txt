SANJIV KHANNA, J:
1. The present Appeal has been filed by Mr. Prakash Chand Kapoor
and four others (hereinafter referred to as the Appellants for short)

LPA No. 1041/2004

and is directed against the judgement dated 4

Page No.2
th

August, 2004

passed by the learned Single Judge dismissing their Writ Petition.
2. It is an admitted case of the parties that in 1964, land including built
up structure belonging to Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor, father of the
appellant nos. 1-4 was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act,
1894. Compensation was awarded and paid to Mr. Manik Chand
Kapoor towards acquisition of the land including the structures
constructed on it.
3. It appears that Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor did not hand over vacant
possession of the constructed building and continued to remain in
occupation of about 225 sq. yds of land.
4. In these circumstances, the Delhi Development Authority in 1989
issued notices under Section 4(1) of the Public Premises (Eviction
of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1975.
th

5. The Estate Officer passed an eviction Order on 25 March, 1996.
The said Order was made the subject matter of appeal but was
dismissed by the appellate authority except with regard to area of
60 sq. yds which was being used for religious purpose and was

LPA No. 1041/2004

Page No.3

therefore left out of acquisition in Award No. 1716 of 1964-65.
6. The Order passed under the

Public Premises (Eviction of

Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1975 was challenged in the Writ
Petition No.2863/2001. As Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor had expired in
April, 2000, the said Writ Petition was filed by the appellants as his
legal representatives.
7. In the said Writ Petition it was averred that Mr. Manik Chand
Kapoor was entitled to an alternative plot of 500 sq.yds as per the
policy and guidelines supported by Rule 2(1) of the DDA (Disposal
of Developed Nazul Land) Rules, 1981. In this regard, it was stated
that the respondent had formulated a scheme for allotment of
alternative land under the Large Scale Acquisition, Development
and Disposal of Land in Delhi. It was further stated that on 26

th

March, 1989 the Land and Building Department of Delhi
Administration had invited applications from all persons who were
left out and were not given alternative land. The appellants pleaded
that their father, late Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor had submitted an
th

th

application on 24 April, 1989 before the last date i.e. 30 April,

LPA No. 1041/2004

Page No.4

1989. It was claimed that in response to the said application, father
th

of the appellants had received communication dated 28 August,
1989 from Land and Building Department requiring him to submit
requisite information.
8. Learned Single Judge after referring to the above facts did not find
any merit in the Writ Petition in so far as challenge was made to the
Orders

passed

under

the

Public

Premises

(Eviction

of

Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1975 as admittedly, the land in
question had been acquired and compensation for the said land
including structures on it had been paid. The appellants, it was
held, were unauthorised occupants. It was also recorded by the
learned Single Judge that compensation had been duly received by
Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor.
9. On the question of alternative allotment, learned Single Judge
referred to the records produced by the Land and Building
Department of Government of NCT of Delhi. Learned Single Judge
th

has recorded that two communications dated 9 December, 1991
and 30

th

December, 1991 raising certain queries and asking for

LPA No. 1041/2004

Page No.5

information and documents were addressed to Mr. Manik Chand
Kapoor but the same remained unanswered and therefore for
failure to submit requisite information and documents, the
application filed by Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor was rejected on 23

rd

January, 1992. Learned Single Judge noticed that the appellants
did not challenge the said decision rejecting their application.
Accordingly, it was held that the appellants were not entitled to
allotment of alternative plot and the Writ Petition was dismissed.
10.Learned counsel for the appellants, while not disputing the above
facts, submitted that right to alternative land is accepted and
recognised under the DDA (Disposal of Developed Nazul Land)
Rules, 1981 and Section 21(2)(i) of the Delhi Development Act,
1957. A reference was made to the decision in the case of State of
U.P. Versus Pista Devi and Others reported in (1986) 4 SCC 251
and our attention was drawn to the observations of the Supreme
Court therein. It has been held that the provision for allotment of
alternative land when land is acquired, is justified and is based
upon wholesome principle. Reliance was also placed upon the Full

LPA No. 1041/2004

Page No.6

Bench decision of this Court in the case of Shiv Devi Virlley
versus Lt. Governor of Delhi and others reported in AIR 1987
Delhi 46 on the question of “owner” and it was submitted that the
appellants are entitled to alternative land as they were “owners” of
the land which had been acquired. It was argued that the appellants
or their father had never received the communications dated 9
December, 1991 and 30
the Order dated 23

rd

th

th

December, 1991 and were not aware of
January, 1992 rejecting their father's

application for allotment of alternative land. It was submitted that
there are no postal receipts and A.D. cards on the file and therefore
the learned Single Judge had erred in relying upon the records and
the letters/communications to deny relief to the appellants.
Reference was made to the office notings with reference to letter
th

dated 30 December, 1991 wherein it was not specifically recorded
that this letter was to be sent under registered post.
11.As far as the challenge to the orders passed under the Public
Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants) Act, 1975 is
concerned, there is no merit in the appeal. The appellants are in

LPA No. 1041/2004

Page No.7

fact taking contradictory stand. The argument raised by the
appellants for claiming alternative plot is based upon acquisition of
the land and structure belonging to their father, late Mr. Manik
Chand Kapoor. It has been specifically admitted that the father of
the appellants had received compensation. Admittedly the land has
been acquired and “possession” handed over to the DDA. Concept
of “possession” has been considered by a Division Bench of this
Court in the case of Nagin Chand Godha versus Union of India
and others reported in 2003 (70) DRJ 721. After referring to
several decisions of the Supreme Court as well as this Court, it was
held that symbolic or formal delivery of possession is sufficient
under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and the person who continues
to enjoy actual physical possession is merely a trustee. It has been
further held that it is the duty of the person physically occupying the
property to look after the property and to see that the property is not
defaced or devalued. The occupant cannot come to a Court and
say that he is in actual possession and therefore his possession
has to be protected and the land should be denotified. Order for

LPA No. 1041/2004

Page No.8

eviction therefore, has been rightly passed and there is no merit in
the challenge to the said orders.
12.On the question of allotment of alternative plot, we have examined
the file relating to Land and Building Department of Government of
NCT of Delhi. The despatch registers have also been produced
before us. Application dated 28

th

April, 1989 filed by Mr. Manik

Chand Kapoor is available on the said file. In the application, it is
mentioned that 13 bighas and 3 biswas of land owned by the
applicant-Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor were acquired vide Award dated
29

th

April,

1964

and

he

was

Rs.1,30,390/-. By letter dated 28

th

awarded

compensation

of

August, 1989, the Land and

Building Department called upon Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor to
furnish information on two questions. Firstly, whether physical
possession has been handed over and full compensation has been
paid and whether any reference in respect of the land acquired was
pending. As per the records, no response to the said queries was
received from the applicant-Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor and thereafter
th

two letters dated 9 December, 1991 and 30

th

December, 1991

LPA No. 1041/2004

Page No.9

were written. By these letters certain information was again
required to be furnished. The notings in the office file of the Land &
Building Department of Government of NCT of Delhi shows that
copies of mutation were required to be obtained from late Mr. Manik
Chand Kapoor because correctness of his share could not be
ascertained. The notings also show that as there was no response
from father of the appellants, the application for issue of alternative
rd

land was rejected and communication dated 23 January, 1992
was issued rejecting the application of Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor for
allotment of alternative land. We have examined the despatch
th

registers. As per the said despatch registers, on 9
1991 vide Srl. No. 58626 letter dated 9

th

December,

December, 1991 was

rd

issued and on 23 January, 1992 vide Srl. No. 2792 letter dated
rd

23 January, 1992 was issued.
13.It appears that Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor was all along in
occupation of 225 sq.yds of land. He was perhaps hoping that the
said land will be denotified. He was also conscious of the fact that if
he was allotted alternative land he would have to first vacate the

LPA No. 1041/2004

Page No.10

land in his possession including the super-structure. He was
apparently contesting proceedings before the estate officer, inspite
of the fact that compensation had been received. Mr. Manik Chand
Kapoor

took

his

chance.

He

letters/communications dated 9

th

did

not

reply

to

the

December, 1991 and 31

st

December, 1991 nor challenged/questioned rejection of his
application for allotment of alternative land communicated vide
rd

letter dated 23 January, 1992. Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor expired in
2000.
14.The appellants raked up the issue of alternative allotment for the
first time when they filed a writ petition after orders were passed
under the Public Premises (Eviction of Unauthorised Occupants)
Act, 1975 in the year 2001. There is, therefore, substantial delay
and laches in approaching the Court against the communication
rejecting the request for allotment of alternative land. Thus, the
period of delay and laches from 1992-2001, of more than nine
years, remains unexplained. No reason is forthcoming from the
appellants. The stand of the appellants that they were never
informed, did not receive any communication and they had no
knowledge of the rejection of their application for allotment of
alternative land has been rightly rejected in view of the despatch

LPA No. 1041/2004

Page No.11

registers produced before us. Moreover, it is difficult to believe that
Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor or his children, the appellants would not
have taken steps and would have remained quite all along during
this period, when others whose lands had been acquired were
given alternative land in terms of the Scheme. The only plausible
explanation in these circumstances is that Mr. Manik Chand Kapoor
took his chance and wanted to continue to occupy the land in his
occupation and possession and was not interested in allotment of
alternative land and therefore never chose to question and
challenge the order rejecting his application for allotment of
alternative land in 1992.
15.In these circumstances, we do not find any merit in the present
Appeal and the same is accordingly dismissed.
No order as to costs.
