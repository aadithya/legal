ORDER
19.03.2008

The petitioner M/s Indure Private Limited has filed the present writ

petition challenging bill dated 27th April, 2006 raised by respondent-Distcom
M/s BSES Rajdhani Private Limited claiming arrears of Rs.14,61,552.50.
2.

In the counter affidavit filed by respondent-Distcom it is stated that

meter installed in the premises of the petitioner at flat No.1/2/3, DLF Building,
Cinema Complex, Greater Kailash Part-II, New Delhi was defective during the
period 9th January, 1998 to 14th March, 2001 i.e. for 1160 days and the
arrears raised are for this period. It was further stated that arrears have been
raised on the basis of two base periods between 5th June, 1997 to 9th January,

1998 and 14th March, 2001 to 31st October, 2001. It is an admitted case that
these arrears were raised without referring the matter to Electrical Inspector
under Section 26(6) of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, which reads as under:“26.(6) Where any difference or dispute arises as to
whether any meter referred to in sub-section (1) is or
is not correct, the matter shall be decided, upon the
application of either party, by an Electrical Inspector;
and where the meter has, in the opinion of such
Inspector ceased to be correct, such Inspector shall
estimate the amount of the energy supplied to the
consumer or the electrical quantity contained in the
supply, during such time, not exceeding six months,
as the meter shall not, in the opinion of such
Inspector, have been correct; but save as aforesaid,
the register of the meter shall, in the absence of fraud,
be conclusive proof of such amount or quantity:”

3.

The said provision stipulates that Electrical Inspector shall estimate the

amount of energy supplied to the consumer or electrical quantity contained in
the supply when the meter is defective, during such time, not exceeding six
months. The said provision was interpreted by this Court in MCD versus H.D.
Shourie, reported in 1994 (1) AD (Delhi) 105.
4.

It may be relevant to state here that the petitioner had earlier

approached Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum after receiving electricity
bill for the billing period July, 2004 in which arrears of Rs.3,14,204.76 were
claimed. The complaint made by the petitioner was examined and by an
order dated 24th November, 2005 the same was disposed of. In fact, after

disposal of the complaint the respondent-Distcom in their letter dated 6th May,
2006 had informed the petitioner that the total amount payable by him is only
Rs.17.29. Thus, there is merit in the contention of the petitioner that the
respondent-Distcom had earlier also examined the aspect of arrears and
thereafter respondent-Distcom had calculated the total amount payable by the
petitioner as Rs.17.29.
5.

In these circumstances, the petitioner is justified in his prayer that he

should not be asked to deposit 50% of the bill amount of Rs.14,61,552.50
before the Consumer Grievance Redressal Forum hears their second
complaint.

For reasons given above, the order passed by the Consumer

Grievance Redressal Forum dated 26th May, 2006 directing petitioner to
deposit 50% of the arrears of Rs.14,61,552.50, is quashed and set aside. The
complaint made by the petitioner will be heard by the Consumer Grievance
Redressal Forum without deposit of the said amount and electricity supply of
the petitioner will also not be disconnected for failure to deposit the said
amount till speaking order is passed by the Consumer Grievance Redressal
Forum on merits. In case the petitioner or the respondent-Distcom has any
grievance against the speaking order, which will be passed by the said forum,
they can file appropriate proceedings to challenge the said order.
6.

The observations and findings given in this order are for the purpose of

disposing the present writ petition and will not be binding on the Consumer

Grievance Redressal Forum, which will decide the complaint made by the
petitioner on merits without being influenced by the said observations.
7.

The writ petition is accordingly disposed of. There is no order as to

costs.
