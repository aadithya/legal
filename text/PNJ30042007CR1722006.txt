PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 28.2.2006

passed by the learned Addl. District Judge, Delhi in Execution
No.865/2006.
2.

The learned Judge, while executing the decree, held

that as per the decree, interest on the solatium payable as
per the enhanced compensation and additional amount
payable under Section 23 (1-A) of the Land Acquisition Act,
CR 172/2006

Page No.1 of 8

1894 have not been granted, therefore petitioner would not
be entitled to said 2 components of interest.
3.

The learned Judge has held that the Executing Court

cannot modify the decree.
4.

Agricultural land of the petitioner was acquired.

Being dissatisfied with the compensation determined by the
Land Acquisition Collector he sought a reference under
Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.

The said

reference was registered as LAC No.14/1997. It was disposed
of vide order dated 3.2.2000. Relief granted was as under :-

5.

'8.
Relief:- In view of my findings on issue
no.1 above, I fix the market value of the acquired
land in question at the rate of 28,000/- per bigha.
Beside this, the petitioner will get solatium @ 30%
on the market value of land fixed in the case. The
petitioner will also be entitled to interest @ 9%
per annum from the date of dispossession till the
expiry of one year and thereafter @ 15% per
annum till payment on the enhanced amount.
The petitioner will be entitled to proportionate
costs.”
Issue which came up before the learned Executing

Court was whether revisionist was entitled interest on the
additional amount and the solatium.
6.

The same has been denied.

7.

Learned counsel for the revisionist, Shri N.S.Chechi

urges that the right flows from the statutory amendments
CR 172/2006

Page No.2 of 8

incorporated to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. Per contra,
Shri Sanjay Poddar, learned counsel for the respondent,
drawing attention to the decision of a Division Bench of this
court reported as 120 (2005) DLT 353, Daulat Ram & Ors. Vs.
UOI urged that the Executing Court cannot go behind the
decree.
8.

Responding to the statement of Shri Sanjay Poddar,

learned counsel for the respondents, Shri N.S.Chechi, counsel
for the petitioner places reliance upon 2 decisions of the
Supreme Court reported as (2007) SCCR 150 Patel Joitaram
Kalidas Vs. Special Land Acquisiton Officer
Supreme 521 Gurpreet Singh Vs. UOI.

and 2007 (1)

Counsel additionally

places reliance upon an unreported decision dated 10.1.2003
passed by a Division Bench of this Court in RFA No.385/78
Bhulan Vs. LAC & Ors.
9.

The controversy has arisen in view of a decision of

the Supreme Court reported as 93 (2001) DLT 569 Sunder Vs.
UOI.

The decision is dated 19.9.2001.

Prior to the said

decision, law as interpreted by the Supreme Court vide
decision reported as (1996) SCC 71 Prem Nath Kapoor Vs.
National Fertilizers was that interest is payable only on the

CR 172/2006

Page No.3 of 8

enhanced compensation and not on solatium and additional
amount payable under Section 23(1-A) of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894.

In Sunder's case, Supreme Court held that

interest would be payable even on the solatium and the
additional amount payable under Section 23(1-A) of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894.
10.

The effect thereof was that decisions by the

reference courts, under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition
Act, 1894, which are a decree, passed prior to 19.9.2001 do
not contain a direction for payment of any interest on the
solatium and additional amount directed to be paid under
Section 2 (1-A) of the L.A. Act, 1894. Decrees passed after
19.9.2001 contain such a direction.
11.

No doubt, in Bhulan's case (supra), a Division Bench

of this court held that law as declared by the Supreme Court
in Sunder's case (supra) would apply to all decrees, whether
or not a specific direction was passed for payment of interest
on the solatium on the enhanced compensation as also
additional amount payable under Section 23 (1-A) of the Land
Acquisition Act, 1894, but in Daulat Ram's case another
Division Bench of this court held to the contrary.

CR 172/2006

Page No.4 of 8

12.

In Daulat Ram's case it was held that an Executing

Court has to execute the decree as passed and cannot modify
the decree in light of subsequent decision of the Supreme
Court delivered after the date of the decree. It was held that
the Executing Court has to execute the decree as passed.
13.

The said Division Bench noted the decision in

Bhulan's case.

It held that in view of the decision of the

Supreme Court reported as JT 2004 (8) SC 202 Desraj Vs. UOI,
a decision pronounced subsequent to the decision in Bhulan's
case, law as declared in Bhulan's case was in conflict with the
law declared by the Supreme Court in Desraj's case.
14.

Since decision in Daulat Ram's case is subsequent

to the decision in Bhulan's case and has noted the decision in
Bhulan's case, I am bound to follow the decision in Daulat
Ram's case.
15.

Decision in Patel

Joitaram Kalidas's case (supra)

relied upon by the petitioner is not applicable for the reason
in said decision the original proceedings were continuing.
The petitioner before the Supreme Court was aggrieved by
the

decision of the reference court denying interest which

was upheld by the High Court. In continuation of the original

CR 172/2006

Page No.5 of 8

proceedings, matter had reached the Supreme Court.
16.

In view of the decision in Sunder's case, the

Supreme Court directed payment of interest on the solatium
awarded on the enhanced compensation as also on the
amount payable

under Section 23

(1-A)

of the Land

Acquisition Act, 1894. In para 18 of the report, the Supreme
Court clearly observed that the decision was on the facts
peculiar to the case and as a special case in the interest of
justice.
17.

Para 44 of the decision in Gurpreet Singh's case

(supra), which was relied upon, reads as under :'44. On other question also was sought to be
raised and answered by this Bench though
not referred to it.
Considering that the
question arises in various cases pending in
courts all over the country, we permitted
counsel to address us on that question. That
question is whether in the light of the decision
in Sunder (supra), the awardee, decree holder
would be entitled to claim interest on
solatium in execution though it is not
specifically granted by the decree. It is well
settled that an execution court cannot go
behind the decree. If, therefore, the claim for
interest on solatium had been made and the
same has been negatived either expressly or
by necessary implication by the judgment or
decree of the reference court or of the
appellate court, the execution court will have
necessarily to reject the claim for interest on
solatium based on Sunder (supra) on the
CR 172/2006

Page No.6 of 8

18.

ground that the execution court cannot go
behind the decree. But if the award of the
reference court or that of the appellate court
does not specifically refer to the question of
interest on solatium or in cases where claim
had not been made and rejected either
expressly or impliedly by the reference court
or the appellate court, and merely interest on
compensation is awarded, then it would be
open to the execution court to apply the ratio
of Sunder (supra) and say that the
compensation awarded includes solatium and
in such an event interest on the amount could
be directed to be deposited in execution.
Otherwise, not. We also clarify that such
interest on solatium can be claimed only in
pending executions and not in closed
executions and the execution court will be
entitled to permit its recovery from the date
of judgment in Sunder (September 19, 2001)
and not for any prior period. We also clarify
that this will not entail any reappropriation or
fresh appropriation by the decree holder.
This we have indicated by way of clarification
also in exercise of our power under Articles
141 and 142 of the Constitution of India with
a view to avoid multiplicity of litigation on this
question.”
Therefore, relief granted to the petitioner by the

reference court, i.e. the decree in question needs to be noted.
19.

In para 4 above I have noted the operative part of

the order containing the directions.
20.

Perusal thereof shows that the reference court has

consciously

restricted

compensation,

only

has

been

Page No.7 of 8

awarded on the enhanced solatium and amount payable
under Section 23 (1-A) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.
21.

The reference court was conscious of the claim for

interest.

On one facet only interest has been allowed.

Obviously, qua the others, the interest would be deemed to
be disallowed.
22.

Thus, even as per the decision in Gurpreet Singh's

case, no case is made out for interference.
23.

The petition is dismissed.

24.

No costs.
