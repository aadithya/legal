1.

The petitioner, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Limited is a

company registered under Section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956,
with the Central Government and the Government of National Capital
Territory of Delhi each having 50% holding. This is the third round of

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 2

litigation between the petitioner and Delhi Municipal Corporation, the
respondent herein, on the question whether the petitioner is liable to
pay property tax and other taxes under the provisions of Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957. The petitioner had earlier filed Civil
Writ No. 2065/2002, which was allowed vide order dated 4th April,
2002 with the direction to the Assessing Authority to decide the
question whether the petitioner is liable to pay tax in view of Section
184 of the Railways Act, 1989 (hereinafter referred to as the 1989
Act, for short). After remand, the Additional Assessor and Collector
passed another assessment order but again without deciding the
question whether Section 184 of the 1989 Act was attracted. This
Court in Civil Writ No. 1531/2003 quashed the said assessment order
and remanded back the matter for determination whether the
petitioner is liable to pay tax or is protected under Section 184 of
1989 Act.
2.

The assessment order now passed by the Assessor and

Collector on 30th March, 2005, in paragraph 3 refers to Section 184
of the 1989 Act, but the entire order is silent and does not specifically
deal with the said Section.

The Assessor and Collector has

examined Section 119 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act and
corporate entity of the petitioner, which makes it liable to pay taxes as
any other individual or corporate entity, but the main question
whether or not section 184 of the 1989 Act is attracted, is not

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 3

answered. The simplest course for this Court is to again remand back
the matter to the Assessor and Collector to decide the question of
applicability of Section 184 of 1989 Act. However, both the parties
were reluctant and have addressed arguments on merits with
reference to Section 184 of 1989 Act. I therefore proceed to decide
the Writ Petition.
3.

At the outset, it may be noticed that both 1989 Act and Delhi

Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 are Central Acts enacted by the
Parliament. Similarly, the Metro Railways (Construction of Works)
Act, 1978 and the Delhi Metro Railway (Operation and Maintenance)
Act, 2002 (hereinafter referred to as the 1978 Act and 2002 Act
respectively, for short) have been enacted by the Parliament.
4.

Section 184 of the 1989 Act reads as under:“184. Taxation on railway by local
authorities.- (1) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in any other law a
railway administration shall not be liable to
pay any tax in aid of the funds of any local
authority unless the Central Government, by
notification,
declares
the
railway
administration to be liable to pay the tax
specified in such notification.
(2) While a notification of the Central
Government under sub-section (1) is in force,
the railway administration shall be liable to
pay to the local authority either the tax
specified in the notification or in lieu thereof,
such sum, if any, as an officer appointed in
this behalf by the Central Government may,
having regard to all the circumstances of the

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 4

case, from time, to time, determine to be fair
and reasonable.
(3) The Central Government may at any time
revoke or vary a notification issued under subsection (1).
(4) Nothing in this section shall be construed
to prevent any railway administration from
entering into a contract with any local authority
for the supply of water or light, or for the
scavenging of railway premises, or for any
other service which the local authority may
render or be prepared to render to the railway
administration.”
5.

The said Section in rather plain and unambiguous words, with a

non obstante clause over-riding any other enactment, states that
“railway administration” shall not be liable to pay any tax to a local
authority for their funds. This, however, is subject to the condition
that the Central Government can by a notification declare that
”railway administration” shall be liable to pay tax as specified in the
said notification. Exemption from tax by a local authority is granted to
“railway administration”. This exemption is notwithstanding any other
law to the contrary. Thus, notwithstanding the provisions of Delhi
Municipal Corporation Act, 1957, a “railway administration” is not
liable to pay tax under the said enactment, in view of Section 184 of
the 1989 Act.

It may be noted here that the Delhi Municipal

Corporation Act, 1957 is prior in point of time and it was not
contended by the respondents that Section 184 of the 1989 Act will
not over ride the provisions of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957.
It is also not the case of the respondents that any notification has

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 5

been issued by the Central Government under Section 184 of the
1989 Act declaring that the “Railway Administration” is liable to pay
tax specified in the notification.
6.

The term “railway administration” has been defined in Section 2

(32) of 1989 Act as under:“2(32) “railway administration”’ in relation to –
(a) a Government railway, means the General
Manager of a Zonal Railway; and
(b) a non-Government railway, means the person
who is the owner or lessee of the railway or
the person working the railway under an
agreement.”
7.

The said definition does not in fact specifically define the term

“railway administration” but indicates that in relation to a Government
Railway, it means the General Manager and in relation to nonGovernment Railway, it means and refers to the person who is the
owner, lessee of the Railway or the person working the railway under
an agreement. The purpose and object of Section 2 (32) is to pin
point the individual who will be treated as the Administrator of the
Railway in the case of governmental and non-governmental railway.
Purpose and objective of Clause 2(32) of 1989 Act is to identify the
Administrator and not as such to define the expression.

However,

the definition clause indicates that “railway administration” includes
both Governmental Railway and non-Governmental Railway.

This

becomes clear in view of definition given to the terms “Governmental
Railway” and “Non-Governmental Railway” in Sections 2 (20) and

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 6

(25) of the 1989 Act. Governmental Railway means a railway owned
by the Central Government and Non-Governmental Railway means a
railway other than a Government Railway.

includes

both

Government

as

Thus, “railway
well

as

Non-

Government Railway and exemption granted under Section 184 of
1989 Act will apply to both Governmental Railway as well as NonGovernmental Railway.
8.

The next question, which arises for consideration is whether the

petitioner is in fact a “Railway”, which is a pre-condition for Section
184 of the 1989 Act to apply and, therefore, can be regarded as
“Railway” within the expression “railway administration”.

The word

“Railway” has been defined in Section 2 (31) of the 1989 Act in the
following words:“2(31) “railway” mans a railway, or any portion
of a railway, for the public carriage of
passengers or goods, and includes(a) all lands within the fences or other
boundary marks indicating the limits of the
land appurtenant to a railway;
(b) all lines of rails, sidings, or yards, or
branches used for the purposes of, or in
connection with, a railway;
(c) all electric traction equipments, power
supply and distribution installations used for
the purposes of, or in connection with, a
railway;
(d) all rolling stock, stations, officers,
warehouses,
wharves,
workshops,
manufactories, fixed plant and machinery,
roads and streets, running rooms, rest

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 7

houses, institutes, hospitals, water works and
water supply installations, staff dwellings and
any other works constructed for the purpose
of, or in connection with, railway;
(e) all vehicles which are used on any road for
the purposes of traffic or a railway and owned,
hired or worked by a railway; and
(f) all ferries, ships, boats and rafts which are
used on any canal, river, lake or other
navigable inland waters for the purposes of
the traffic of a railway and owned, hired or
worked by a railway administration,
but does not include(i)
(ii)

9.

a tramway wholly within a municipal area; and
lines of rails built in any exhibition ground, fair,
park, or any other place solely for the purpose
of recreation;”

The word Railway as per the above definition means Railway or

any portion thereof, but the same should be used for public carriage
of passengers, goods and includes various properties as specified in
Clauses (a) to (f) therein. The term “Railway”, in the first part of the
definition clause relies upon the word “Railway” as is understood in
normal parlance, with a stipulation that it should be used for the
purpose of transportation of public carriage of passengers or goods.
The

Supreme

Court

in the case

of

Shahadara (Delhi)

Saharanpur Light Railway Company versus Municipal
Board reported in AIR 1969

SC 513, had agreed with the

contention of the appellant therein that the expression “Railway” as is
commonly understood means carriage of passengers and goods on
iron rails. The term “Railway” as described in Article 366 (20) does

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 8

not include tramway wholly within the municipal area, line of
communication wholly situated in one State and declared by the
Parliament by law not to be Railway. The petitioner qualifies and is a
Railway within the meaning of Section 2(31) of the 1989 Act. It is
engaged in transportation of passengers on rails. It is a public
carriage. This factual position is not challenged by the respondent.
10.

In view of the reasoning given above, it has to be held that

Section 184 of 1989 Act grants protection from levy of taxation by a
local authority to “railway administration” be it a Government Railway
or a Non Government Railway.

The petitioner, therefore, will be

entitled to protection under Section 184 of the Act to the extent it is
“railway administration” as defined in Section 2 (32) read with Section
2 (25) of the 1989 Act.
11.

The respondent-Corporation in the written submissions has

pleaded that the 1989 Act is not applicable to the petitioner on the
ground that the 2002 and 1978 Acts are applicable. Reference is
made to the definition Clauses of the 2002 Act in which the
expression “Metro Railway” has been defined. It was stated that in
view of specific definitions of the expressions “Metro Railway”, “Metro
Railway Administration”, “Non-Governmental Metro Railway”, etc.; in
the 2002 Act, the expression “railway administration” as defined in
1989 Act is not applicable. It is also contended that the petitioner is a
“Metro Railway” and therefore not “Railway Administration”, under

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 9

Section 184 of the 1989 Act. The argument is fallacious and should
not be accepted. For the purpose of 1989 Act and for applicability of
Section 184, we have to refer to the definitional clauses and other
provisions of the said enactment. It is not necessary to examine the
provisions of the 2002 Act or 1978 Act to interpret and define the
expressions and terms used in 1989 Act. The judgments relied upon
by the respondent rather than supporting the respondent, support the
case of the petitioner.

In Feroze N. Dotivala versus P.M.

Wadhwani and Others, reported in (2003) 1 SCC 433, which was
relied upon by the respondent, it has been held that two similar terms
may not mean the same thing if their definitions in two different
statutes are at variance with each other. Two similar terms can have
two different meanings under two enactments depending upon the
context in which the said terms have been used. Therefore, it will not
be proper to import the definition of the terms “Metro Railway”, etc.
used in 2002 Act into 1989 Act. 1989 Act is a separate enactment
and it’s clauses have to be interpreted as per the definition given to
the said term in the said enactment. Recourse to 2002 enactment is
not permissible to define “Railway Administration” under 1989 Act. It
is also equally well settled that there can be two separate enactments
dealing with the same subject matter and the question which one of
the two enactments will prevail on a particular issue or question, may
arise in a given case,

but the said question is not relevant and

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 10

material for the present controversy. Therefore, it is not possible to
hold and accept the contention of the respondent corporation that the
petitioner ceases to be “railway administration” within the meaning of
Section 2 (32) of 1989 Act

in view of definition clauses in 2002

enactment or as 2002 Act stands enforced. Moreover, the expression
“Railway” is generic in nature and the expression “Metro Railway” is a
mere specie. “Metro Railway” will be included and forms part of the
generic expression “Railway”.
12.

The definition clauses in 1978 Act and 2002 Act have not been

incorporated into 1989 Act. 2002 Act is, in fact, later in point of time
but no amendments have been made to incorporate the definition
clauses of the said Act into 1989 Act. Similarly, definition clauses in
1978 Act have also not been incorporated into 1989 Act. It is not
permissible to refer to the definition clauses of 1978 Act and 2002 Act
for the purpose of interpreting the expressions and terms used in
1989 Act.

As discussed below, 1978 Act and 2002 Act, are in

addition to and not in derogation of the 1989 Act.
13.

Section 43 of the 1978 Act reads as under:“43. Application of the Indian Railways Act,
1890.- Save as otherwise provided in this Act,
the provisions of this Act shall be in addition
to, and not in derogation of, the *Indian
Railways Act, 1890 (9 of 1890).”

14.

Thus, Section 43 stipulates that the provisions of the said Act

are in addition to and not in derogation of the Indian Railways Act,

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

1890.

Page 11

I may note here that when 1978 Act was enacted, Indian

Railways Act, 1890 was in force before it was repealed and replaced
by 1989 Act.

Section 8(1) of the General Clauses Act, 1879

stipulates that when a Central Act or Regulation made, is repealed or
reenacted with or without modification, then reference made to the
earlier enactment unless different intention appears, shall be
construed as reference to the reenacted Act. The said Section of the
General Clauses Act is applicable.

In this regard, I may refer to

judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Sale Tax Officer
Kanpur and Other versus Union of India and Others, reported in
1995 SUPP 1 SCC 410, wherein the Supreme Court has held that
reference to Indian Railways Act, 1890 in Section 28A (8) of Uttar
Pradesh Sales Tax Act by virtue of Section 8(1) of the General
Clauses Act after repeal of the earlier enactment, will mean as
reference to 1989 Act. Thus, for the purpose of Section 43 of 1978
Act, reference to Indian Railways Act, 1890 will mean reference to
1989 Act. The contention of the respondent Corporation that Section
43 of the 1978 Act has become dead and lifeless because it refers to
Indian Railways Act, 1890 and not to 1989 Act is misconceived. As
noticed above, when 1978 Act was enacted, Indian Railways Act,
1890 was in force but subsequently, 1989 Act was enforced with the
earlier enactment being repealed.

Similarly, for the purpose of

Section 2(2) of 1978 Act reference will have to be made to 1989, Act

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 12

for defining all words and expressions, which have not been defined
in 1978 Act.
15.

Logically, it also follows that when Section 104 of the 2002 Act

makes reference to 1978 Act, it also makes reference to Section 43
of 1978 Act and therefore to 1989 Act. Section 104 of 2002 Act reads
as under:“104. Application of other Acts.- Save as
otherwise provided in this Act, the provisions
of this Act shall be in addition to and not in
derogation
of
the
Metro
Railways
(Construction of Works) Act, 1978 (33 of
1978).”
16.

Thus, the said Section states that provisions of 2002 Act are

in addition and not in derogation of the 1978 Act. The provisions of
1978 Act continue to apply even after 2002 Act was enforced. By
virtue of Section 43 of the 1978 Act the provisions of 1989 Act will
continue to apply and will accordingly be applicable even after
enactment of 2002 Act. It may also be noticed here that the term
“Railway” for the purpose of 2002 Act has been defined in Section
2(P) to mean Railways as defined in Section 2 (31) of the 1989 Act.
Section 2 (2) of 2002 Act also states that words and expressions not
used but defined in 1978 Act shall have the same meaning as
assigned to them under the Act. The legislature while enacting 1978
Act and 2002 Act has followed the legislative device of “incorporation”
and for the sake of convenience avoided verbatim reproduction of
parts of the earlier Acts into the later Acts. The provisions of the

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 13

earlier Act, therefore, to the extent stipulated get incorporated and
become part and parcel of the later Act as if they have been bodily
transposed. It cannot be said that in the present case incorporation is
by reference and, therefore, modification or reenactment of the
statute will not have any effect and the original provisions will
continue to apply or in other words the provisions of Indian Railways
Act, 1890 will continue to apply as far as 1978 Act is concerned. The
present case is one of incorporation and not of mere reference and,
therefore, upon re-enactment, the new enactment will apply.

The

legislative intent is clear and does not permit acceptance of the plea
raised by the respondent. It has also been specifically provided in
2002 Act that the provisions will be in addition to but not in derogation
of the 1978 Act. The 1989 Act continues to apply in view of Section
104 of 2002 Act and Section 43 of the 1978 Act.
17.

In view of the above discussion, the contention of the

respondent that in case of any ambiguity in exemption provisions,
interpretation should be in favour of the State rather than the tax
payer, in the present case is held to be not applicable. There is no
ambiguity or doubt in ascertaining the meaning and interpreting
Section 184 of 1989 Act. Therefore, the judgment of the Supreme
Court in the case of State Level Committee and Another versus
Morgardshammar India Limited, reported in (1996) 1 SCC 108 is

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 14

not applicable. This judgment may be of relevance on the aspect,
discussed below.
18.

For the reasons given above, it is accordingly held that Section

184 of the 1989 Act applies and the petitioner is entitled to exemption
under the said Section.

The impugned orders passed by the

respondents holding that the petitioner is liable to pay tax under the
provisions of Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 to this extent is
liable to be set aside and quashed.
19.

However, it is clarified that this Court has not examined and

gone into the question with reference to liability of third parties, other
than the petitioner to pay property tax and other taxes. It is open to
the respondent to examine agreements and transactions entered into
between the petitioner and the third parties to verify and decide
whether the said third parties are liable to pay tax.
20.

Another aspect which requires consideration is whether and

which type of properties qualify and can be regarded as “Railway” for
the purpose of Section 2 (31) of the 1989 Act and whether certain
properties belonging to the petitioner do not qualify and cannot be
regarded as Railway properties and, therefore, are not entitled to
exemption under Section 2 (32) read with Section 184 of the 1989
Act.

This aspect has not been examined by the Assessor and

Collector and requires detailed scrutiny and examination.
details will also have to be examined.

Factual

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 15

21. This question requires interpretation of Section 184 and the term
“railway administration” and whether it includes properties not
specified in Clauses (a) to (f) of Section 2 (31) of 1989 Act. It was
pointed out by the counsel for the petitioner that under Section 184 of
the 1989, Act, exemption or immunity has been granted to “Railway
Administrator” from payment of taxes to local authorities. As already
held above, the expression “railway administration” has not been
defined in Section 2 (32) of 1989 Act but the said definition merely
stipulates the person who will be regarded as an Administrator of the
Railway in question. The said sub-section, therefore, seeks to pin
point and specifically state the person who will be regarded as the
Administrator of Railway in both Governmental Railway and nonGovernmental Railway. A conjoint reading of Sections 2(31), 2 (32)
and 184 of the1989 Act would indicate that Administrator of Railway
is exempt from payment of taxes in respect of a “Railway” as defined
in Section 2 (31). A property or a transaction which does not fall
within four corners of Section 2 (31), is not granted protection or
immunity from taxation by local authorities under Section 184 of 1989
Act.

Section 184 of 1989 Act, therefore, grants immunity to an

Administrator of a Railway only in respect of assets as defined in
Section 2 (31) and not in respect of other assets. Assets/properties
or transactions not mentioned in Clauses (a) to (f), of Section 2 (31),
will be liable to and can be subjected to tax by local authorities. I may

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 16

notice here that the words used in Section 2 (31) of 1989 Act
supports the above construction. Section 2 (31) defines Railways in
terms of “means and includes”, with a separate and clear portion
within the definitional clause that sets out things that are to be
included and are not to be included within the scope and ambit of the
said definition. When the words “means” and “include” are both used
in definition clause, the definition is considered to be exhaustive (See
in this regard observations of the Supreme Court in Mahalakshmi Oil
Mills versus State of Andhra Pradesh, reported in AIR 1989 SC
335, wherein item No. 4 of the Ist Schedule of the Central Excise and
Salt Act, 1944, which defines tobacco to mean any form of tobacco,
whether cured or uncured and whether manufactured or not, and
includes the leaf, stalks and stems of the tobacco plant, but does not
include any part of a tobacco plant while still attached to the earth
was interpreted. It was held that the definition was exhaustive and,
therefore, tobacco seeds cannot be regarded as tobacco). The view
taken is also fortified by the decision of the Supreme Court in the
case of Sales Tax Officer Kanpur (supra).

In the said case,

reference was made to definition of “Railway” in Section 3 (4) of the
Indian Railways Act, 1890 for the purpose of deciding whether
exemption granted under Section 28A (8) of the Uttar Pradesh Sales
Tax Act in favour of Railway Administration was applicable.

The

question that arose for consideration was whether city booking

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 17

agencies were “Railways” for the purpose of Section 28A (8) of the
Uttar Pradesh Sales Tax Act. It was held that for a city booking
agency to fall within the expression “Railways”, it must fall within one
of the categories mentioned in Clauses (a) to (f) mentioned in Section
2 (31) of 1989 Act or Clauses (A) to (D) of Section 3 (4) of Indian
Railways Act, 1890. It was also observed that this question could be
decided if the relevant rules, orders and instructions including the
contract agreement between the Railway and the city booking
agencies were examined. The case was accordingly remanded back
to the High Court to decide the question whether city booking
agencies fall within the expression “Railways”.
22.

The result of the above discussion is that anything which falls

within the definition of term “Railway” cannot be taxed by the
respondent under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 in view
of Section 184 of the 1989 Act. However, the respondent is entitled
to tax under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, 1957 the assets
and properties, which do not fall and are not “Railways” within the
meaning of Section 2 (31) of the 1989 Act. A bare reading of the
Section 2 (31) of 1989 Act will show that lines, electrical equipments,
installations, stations, warehousing workshops, running room, rest
house etc. constructed for the purpose of or in connection with the
railway are exempted from taxation under the Delhi Municipal
Corporation Act, 1957. The Delhi Municipal Corporation will have to

W.P. (C) No. 3152/2006

Page 18

establish and show that a particular building or asset can be taxed
under the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act as it does not fall within the
meaning of “Railway” as defined in Section 2 (31) of 1989 Act. This
aspect requires examination and to this limited extent the matter is
remanded back to the Assessor and Collector for fresh adjudication.
The Assessor and Collector will keep the ratio of this decision in mind
and ensure that properties or assets mentioned in Section 2 (31) of
1989 Act are not taxed. He shall give a specific finding on each
asset/property brought to tax. The petitioner will cooperate and
furnish all details, documents and information in this regard to the
Assessor and Collector.
23.

In view of the findings given above, it is held that the petitioner

is entitled to exemption from payment of municipal taxes in view of
Section 184 of 1989 Act, but only in respect of assets/properties
which have been defined as Railway in Section 2 (31) and not in
respect of other assets/properties.

It is also clarified that this is

subject to issue of notification by Central Government withdrawing
the said exemption and also subject to right of the respondent- Delhi
Municipal Corporation to raise and claim property tax from third
parties, if permissible and allowed under law. The writ petition is
accordingly allowed to the extent indicated above. In the facts and
circumstances of the case, there will be no order as to costs.
