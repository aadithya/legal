1.

This petition has been filed by the petitioner praying for review

of the order dated 10th February, 2003 passed in CM No.1660/2006
in Writ Petition (C) No.3494/2003. By way of CM No.1660/2006,
the

petitioner

has

sought

restoration

of

the

writ

petition

no.3494/2003 which had been disposed of on 11th October, 2004.
The petitioner has contended that the petition was disposed of as
withdrawn without his knowledge and consequently he had sought its
restoration and consequential hearing thereon.

This petition has

been filed as the petitioner assailed the order dated 10th February,
2006 passed by this court before the Supreme Court of India. The
SLP (C) No.7466/2006 filed by the petitioner which was registered as
Civil Appeal No.4942/2006, was disposed of by the court on the
following terms:"We have heard the appellant-in-person and
Mr. Amrendra Saran, learned ASG appearing on
behalf of the respondents.
We have perused the order passed by the
High Court of Delhi in W.P. No.3494/2003 dated
10.02.2006. The High Court while disposing of the
Writ Petition made the following observation in
para 2 of its order:"CM No.1660/2006
By this application, the petitioner is
seeking recall of the order dated 11th
October, 2004 and rehearing in the writ
petition.
The order was passed on a
statement by the counsel that it does not
challenge the validity of the order dated
13th March, 2002 passed by Respondent
No.1 declining to make reference of the
dispute raised by the petitioner against
RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.2

W.H.O."
When the appellant-in-person was confronted
with the statement as recorded by the High Court
that his counsel does not want to challenge the
validity of the order dated 13th March, 2002 passed
by the respondent no.1 declining to make reference
of the dispute raised by the appellant against
W.H.O., the appellant-in-person said that this
statement was not made by his counsel on record.
We are unable to countenance the said submission.
However, we grant liberty to the appellant-in-person
to approach the High Court by filing a review
application before the said court insofar as it relates
to the statement made by the counsel for the
appellant is concerned. If such a review application
is filed, we request the High Court to entertain and
dispose of the same on merits and in accordance with
law. The appeal stands disposed of accordingly."
2.

The petitioner has appeared in person before this court and

argued his entire application urging all contentions as if he was
urging his main writ petition.
3.

In order to appreciate the reasons and circumstances leading up

to the passing of the order dated 11th October, 2004 as well as the
order dated 10th February, 2006 by this court, it becomes necessary
to notice a few essential facts laid by the parties before this court. It
has been urged that the Wealth Health Organisation ("WHO" for
brevity) is associated in several health related projects of the
Government of India. For the purposes of facilitating these projects,
the WHO appoints consultants by execution of what is termed as "A
Special Service Agreement" which is a fixed tenure appointment on a
fixed remuneration.

The petitioner was so appointed as a

Management Information System Specialist ("MIS specialist" for
RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.3

brevity) in the National Malaria Eradication Programme of
Government of India with which the WHO was associated. These
appointments are made and the agreements are executed by the
WHO after the Government of India confirms the appointment of the
person as a consultant. The petitioner was so appointed as an MIS
Specialist by an agreement executed between him and the WHO on
the 22nd of July, 1996. The appointment was for a period of six
months only which came into effect on 22nd July, 1996 and expired
on the 21st January, 1997 and the petitioner's remuneration was paid
by the WHO. This agreement has been placed before this court by
the petitioner only during the course of arguments on this petition.
The agreement contained a mode for settlement of disputes wherein
it was prescribed that such claim or disputes relating to interpretation
of the execution of the agreement which could not be settled amicably
or through conciliation procedure, would be settled by arbitration.
Perusal of this agreement shows that neither the Union of India nor
any officer on his behalf was a party to this agreement.
4.

It is an admitted position that this special services agreement

with the WHO expired by efflux of time on the 21st of January, 1997.
Aggrieved by the termination of his contract, the petitioner appears
to have agitated an undated claim lodged with the conciliation officer
(Annexure P-4 at page 42 of the paper book) wherein the petitioner
has complained that he had not received any termination letter.

RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.4

5.

The petitioner also addressed a letter dated 6th June, 2005 to

the Law Ministry complaining that he had not received a termination
letter.

On 20th January, 1998, the Government of India addressed

the letter informing the petitioner that his appointment as MIS
Specialist was made under the WHO project and as per the
agreement between the WHO and the petitioner, such assignment
expired on 21st January, 1997.
6.

On or about the 22nd March, 2001, the petitioner filed WP (C)

No.1890/2001

wherein

he

had

arrayed

the

World

Health

Organisation; Directorate of National Malaria and the Union of India
as party respondents. The petitioner had assailed his discontinuation
from the post of MIS Specialist on grounds of arbitrariness and
discrimination and sought the following prayers:"(a) direct the respondents to consider the
representation and provide the petitioner service
either on permanent basis or continuous with
continuance of the post of MIS Specialist; and
(b) issue a writ of mandamus directing the
respondents to consider the appointment of the
petitioner to the post of MIS Specialist as and when
the same is required to be filled in with all other
benefits attached to the post."
7.

This writ petition came up for hearing on 26th March, 2001

when the court passed the following order:"In this writ petition, the petitioner has sought
for continuation of his appointment to the post of
M.I.S. Specialist. It is disclosed from the records
placed before me that the petitioner entered into an
Agreement with the Worth Health Organisation on
RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.5

22nd July, 1996, in terms of which the Petitioner was
assigned a project.
It is contended on behalf of the petitioner that
clause 4 of the said Agreement overrides the other
terms of appointment, therefore, the petitioner is
seeking to enforce/challenge the Agreement entered
into between him and the WHO, which enjoys an
immunity. It is neither a Government agency nor an
instrumental of the state. No writ petition could be
maintained as against such an organisation. Besides
clause 2 of the Agreement states that the Agreement
would on 21st day of January, 1997. The said period
has expired. Reference could also be made clause 16
of the Agreement which states that if there be any
dispute between the parties relating to interpretation
of the execution of the Agreement which cannot be
settled amicably or through conciliation procedure
would have to be settled by arbitration.
In view of the aforesaid position this writ
petition is not maintainable and is dismissed."
No challenge was laid by the petitioner to this order which
has attained finality and would operate as res judicata between the
parties in any further litigation.
8.

After the dismissal of this writ, the petitioner applied to the

conciliation officer seeking a reference of the disputes between the
parties by representation dated 13th July, 2001. The petitioner's
request for reference of the industrial dispute was rejected by an
order passed by the competent authority on 13th March, 2002 passed
by the Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi whereby the
appropriate authority refused to refer the dispute between the
management of the World Health Organisaiton and the petitioner to
industrial adjudication. It was stated in this communication that this
court had by the judgment dated 23rd March, 2001 dismissed the

RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.6

petitioner's writ petition on the ground that the WHO enjoyed
immunity as it was neither a governmental agency nor an instrument
of the state.
9.

The petitioner assailed this order passed on 13th March, 2002

by way of writ petition being WP (C) No.3494/2003 filed only on the
29th April, 2003.

In this writ petition, the petitioner sought

quashing of the order dated 13th March, 2002 and reference of the
industrial disputes raised by him to industrial adjudication making
the Secretary (Labour), National Malaria Eradication Programme
through its Director; Union of India through Secretary; Ministry of
Health & Family Welfare and World Health Organisation as party
respondent to the claim. The writ petition was listed before court on
20th February, 2004 when the World Health Organisation,
respondent no.4 was deleted from the array of parties.

It is

noteworthy that by the order dated 25th March, 2001, this court had
already held that the World Health Organisation was the employer of
the petitioner.

This order had attained finality and the findings

contained therein would bind the petitioner. It is also an admitted
position that the agreement dated 22nd July, 1996 pursuant to which
the petitioner was given employment was executed between the
petitioner and the World Health Organisation.
10.

In these circumstances, on the 11th October, 2004, the WP (C)

No.3494/2003 was dismissed on the ground that the counsel for the

RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.7

petitioner had submitted that he did not challenge the validity of the
order dated 13th March, 2002 passed by the respondent no.1, insofar
as it relates to WHO being the employer of the petitioner.

He,

however, stated that workman should be granted liberty to raise
industrial dispute on the basis that Union of India or other
respondents, but WHO is obliged to take the petitioner in
employment as per terms and conditions of the contract.
11.

Learned counsel appearing for the Union of India contended

that he has no objection to the request being granted provided that
WHO is neither impleaded therein nor any relief is claimed against
them directly or indirectly in that petition.
12.

In this view of the matter, the writ petition was disposed of by

an order passed by this court on 11th October, 2004 with the
following direction :"Learned counsel for the petitioner submits
that he does not challenge the validity of the order
dated 13th March, 2002 passed by the respondent
no.1 in so far as it relates to WHO being the
employer of the petitioner. He, however, states that
workman should be granted liberty to raise
industrial dispute on the basis that Union of India
or other respondents but WHO is obliged to take
the petitioner in employment as per terms and
conditions of the contract.
Learned counsel appearing for the UOI
contends that he would have no objection to the
request being granted provided that WHO is neither
impleaded therein nor any relief is claimed against
them directly or indirectly in that petition.
In view of the statement made by the learned
counsel for the parties, this petition is disposed of
as withdrawn with liberty to the petitioner to raise
RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.8

an industrial dispute by making an application to
appropriate government against the respondent
nos.2 & 3, if permissible in law and keeping in view
the facts and circumstances of the present case."
13.

The petitioner thereafter filed an application being CM

no.1660/2006 seeking recall of the order dated 11th October, 2004.
This application was taken up for hearing by this Court on 10th
February, 2006 when counsel for the petitioner had submitted that
his client was appointed as a Management Information System
Specialist with the National Malaria Eradication Project and reliance
was placed on a telegram from the Director of the Project to the
petitioner in this behalf.

Counsel for the petitioner has submitted

that the application was filed as the petitioner apprehended that he
would be precluded from raising an industrial dispute against his
employer. This Court had noticed that the order dated 11th October,
2004 permitting the petitioner to raise a dispute against respondents
2 & 3 was clear and that the petitioner had been specifically given
liberty to raise an appropriate dispute.

It was in this background

that CM 1660/2006 was dismissed.
This order was assailed by the petitioner before the Apex Court.
14.

I find that vide the order 14th November, 2006 set out in the

foregoing paragraphs, the Apex Court has remanded the matter to
this Court on a limited issue relating to the statement attributed to
the counsel on 11th November, 2004.

Before this Court, during the

hearing of the present review petition, no submissions have been
RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.9

made on this aspect. On the contrary, the petitioner has addressed
arguments on the merits of the matter.
15.

I find that the petitioner had impugned the order dated 13th

March, 2002 passed by the respondent no.1 refusing to refer the
disputes raised by the petitioner to industrial adjudication.

By the

order dated 11th October, 2004, in fact, this grievance of the petitioner
stood addressed inasmuch as he was given liberty to raise an
industrial dispute by making an application to the appropriate
Government against the respondents 2 & 3. So far as the WHO was
concerned, the Court had already returned the binding findings
regarding the dispute redressal forum available to the petitioner
while disposing of the previous writ petition on the 25th March, 2001.
Though the WHO had been deleted from the array of parties before
this Court by the order passed on 20th February, 2004. However, in
the interests of justice, I had issued notice in the present application
to the WHO as well.
16.

Mr.Ranganathan, learned counsel appearing for the WHO has

urged that the WHO is neither a State nor an instrumentality of the
State nor a person which were subject to Article 226 of the
Constitution of India.

Reliance was placed on the judicial

pronouncement reported at (2002) 5 SCC 111 Pradeep Kumar
Biswas Vs. IICB; (2003) 4 SCC 225

G. Bassi Reddy Vs.

ICRI; (2003) 8 SCC 639 Gen Mgr Kisan Sakahari Chini

RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.10

Mills Vs. Satrughan Nishad & upon an unreported judgment of
Allahabad High Court in Rajesh Yadav Vs. UOI.
17.

Learned counsel has placed the United Nation (Previleges &

Immunities) Act, 1947 before this court wherein Section 2 of Article
II provides that the United Nation enjoys immunity from every form
of legal process except in so far as in any particular case, it has
waived its immunity.
By virtue of a notification dated 16th December, 1948 of the
Ministry of External Affairs, Government of India, this immunity was
applied mutatis mutandis to the World Health Organisation and
other organisations of the United Nations.
Reliance has also been placed on the Host agreement dated 9th
November, 1949 between the Government of India and the WHO
whereby also the WHO was granted immunity against legal process.
My attention has been drawn to a decision dated 4th December,
2001 passed in IA No.7551/2001 and Suit No.1700/1999 entitled P.S.
Ochani Vs. WHO & Anr. wherein it was held that the World Health
Organisation enjoys immunity from every legal process except in so
far as it has expressly waived its immunity.
18.

The Division Bench had rejected a challenge to this decision by

its order dated 21st July, 2004 passed in FAO (OS) No.46/2002 P.S.
Ochani Vs. WHO & Anr.

The respondent no.4 has also placed

reliance on the submissions on the pronouncement of the Apex Court

RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.11

reported at (2002) 2 SCC 560 entitled Karnataka State Road
Transport Corporation Vs. Ashrafulla Khan & Ors.; 1997
(10) SCC 264 Vice-Chancellor, University of Allahabad &
Ors. Vs. Dr. Anand Prakash Mishra & Ors. and (1997) 2 SCC
713 entitled Santosh Kumar Verma & Ors. Vs. State of
Bihar & Ors. in support of the contention that the WHO enjoys
complete immunity from all forms of legal process.
19.

In the instant case, even without reference to the detailed legal

submissions made on behalf of the respondent no.4, I find that this
legal position was accepted by the petitioner when Writ Petition
No.1890/2001 was dismissed by this court by the order passed on
25th March, 2001 so far as WHO was concerned on this legal position.
This finding has attained finality and binds these proceedings.
20.

So far as the challenge laid by the petitioner to the statement

made on behalf of his counsel to the effect that it would seek a
reference of the dispute against respondent nos.2 & 3, I find that in
para 18 of CM No.7463/2007 dated 2nd May, 2007 filed by the
petitioner, he has now stated that he was recruited by the Directorate
of NMEP (which is the abbreviation of the National Malaria
Eradication Programme) and that his termination violated Sections
25-G, 25-H & 25-J of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. This plea
requires consideration of the pleadings of the parties as well the facts
which the parties would prove in accordance with law. The merits of

RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.12

this claim would abide by adjudication in an appropriate forum
statutorily prescribed. It is not the case of the petitioner that this
claim has to be decided in the present proceedings.
21.

The petitioner has himself set up a plea that he was employed

by the respondent nos.2 & 3 and has assailed his termination on
several grounds under the Industrial Disputes Act.

Thereby the

petitioner has abandoned the claim laid by him before the Supreme
Court with regard to the refusal to refer the matter against the WHO.
22.

So far as the challenge on merits to the order of termination is

concerned, the petitioner has assailed the order of the respondent
no.1 dated 13th March, 2002 refusing reference of the industrial
adjudication. Liberty to seek reference of dispute against respondent
nos.2 & 3 was granted by this court on the 11th October, 2004.
23.

It is noteworthy that the remand of the matter to this court was

on a limited issue. However, the petitioner appearing in person,
insisted on raising the several issues noticed hereinabove. Learned
counsel for the respondent no.4 has ably assisted the court with the
reference to the record and the submissions which have been
considered herein.
24.

In this view of the matter, I see the challenge laid by the

petitioner to the order recorded on 11th October, 2004 is wholly
misconceived.
This review petition is therefore without merits and is hereby

RP 18/2007 & CM 7463/07 in WP (C) No.3494/2003

Page No.13

dismissed.
The petitioner shall be at liberty to seek reference of the
disputes raised by him in terms of the order dated 11th October,
2004.
