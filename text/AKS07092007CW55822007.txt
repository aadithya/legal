1. These cases have a chequered history. It is round two of the litigation
between the parties. Proceedings in round one were commenced at the
instance of respondent no.3 herein. It felt aggrieved by wrong allotment
of CGHS Units/Dispensaries pursuant to tenders floated by respondent
no.2 herein. While that battle was being fought, in deference to the
prima facie view expressed by the court, an administrative decision was
taken by the respondents 1 and 2 to allot respondent no.3

CGHS

Units/Dispensaries at Yamuna Vihar and Dilshad Garden which were
earlier allotted to two petitioners herein. Thus while giving allotment to
respondent no.3, petitioners were deprived of the aforesaid allotment. As
a consequence, present writ petitions are filed by them challenging the
action of the respondents.

To appreciate the controversy in these

petitions, we may take note of the facts sequentially and in some detail.
2. Respondent no.2 floated tender inviting bids of allotment of CGHS
Units/Dispensaries for supply of medicines and drugs across Delhi-for 32
groups in all. In fact Delhi Region of CGHS is divided in 32 groups. In
each group there are few dispensaries/units. In this writ petition, we are
concerned for group XVIII under which there are 4 dispensaries which

WP(C)Nos.5582-83/07

of

are situated at Vivek Vihar, Shahadara, Yamuna Vihar and Dilshad
Garden. Three bidders finally emerged for consideration of their bids,
namely, (a) M/s.Kailash Chemist ( petitioner in WP(C)No.5582/07), (b)
M/s.Jain

Medicos

(petitioner

in

WP(C)No.5583/07)

M/s.N.G.Medical Agencies (respondent no.3 herein).

and

(c

)

The official

respondents rejected the bid of respondent no.3. With this rejection the
two petitioners were left in the fray. Both were declared as L-1 (Lowest)
bidders and were allotted two dispensaries each in Group XVIII. The
petitioner Kailash Chemist was allotted Vivek Vihar dispensary on
permanent/regular basis and Dilshad Garden dispensary on temporary
basis. Likewise, M/s.Jain Medicos was given the allotment of Shahadara
dispensary on regular basis and Yamuna Vihar dispensary on temporary
basis.
3. Respondent no.3 did not accept the decision of the official respondents in
rejecting its bid. It thus filed WP(C)No.14659-60/2006 in this Court
challenging the said rejection. This writ petition was dismissed by Single
Judge of this Court vide judgment dated 20.9.2006.

Not satisfied,

respondent no.3 took the matter in appeal before Division Bench in the
form of LPA No.1984/2006. Respondent no.3 also filed another WP(C)
WP(C)Nos.5582-83/07

3

of

13

No.16244/2006 in which he arrayed both these petitioners as respondents
though in the first petition they were not made parties. The LPA and WP
were ultimately taken up together. Matter was heard on 17.7.2007 and
following order was passed by the Division Bench:
“We have heard the matter in part. We have also
looked into the records of the appellant. We are
prima facie of the opinion that rejection of the tender
of the appellant on the alleged ground is perverse.
However, in terms of the request made, we grant two
days time to the respondent to obtain instructions
and to look into the record. We would also like to
look into other records of the respondent which led
to the allotment of the contract in question in respect
of group 18 in favour of the allottees and that also
ignoring the case of the appellant.
Renotify on 19th July,2007.
A copy of this order be given dasti to counsel
appearing for the respondent, under signature of the
Court Master.”

4. On 19.7.2007 which was the next date, counsel for respondents 1 and 2
asked for some more time to obtain instructions. It was granted as last
opportunity with clear indication that otherwise the matter would proceed
on merits on the next date which was fixed as 23.7.2007.

5. Thereupon, the official respondents issued two Office Memoranda both
dated 19.7.2007 whereby the allotments of Yamuna Vihar and Dilshad
Garden dispensaries in favour of two petitioners were cancelled and
allotted to respondent no.3. On 23.7.2007 when the matter came up
before the Division Bench, counsel for respondents 1 and 2 produced the
aforesaid two Office Memoranda and in view of the allotments of these
two dispensaries in favour of respondent no.3 the Court permitted
respondent no.3 to withdraw the LPA as well as Writ Petition. While
giving such direction, the following order was passed:
“The respondents have now issued an order dated 19th
July,2007 offering allotment of two dispensaries for
supply of medicine/drugs with immediate effect on the
same terms and conditions at a discount of 5.4% or
printed price for the remaining period 2005-2007.
In view of the aforesaid position and allotment of the
dispensaries to the appellant, learned counsel for the
appellant states that he may be permitted to withdraw
this appeal.
Mr.Rajesh Gupta, learned counsel for the respondent
Nos.10 and 11 in W.P.(C) No.16244-45/2006 states
before us that after issuance of the aforesaid order, the
said respondents are not permitted to supply
medicine/drugs to the aforesaid dispensaries. Learned
counsel appearing for the CGHS Medical Store Depot
states that they would continue to supply
medicine/drugs to other dispensaries. Order dated 19th
WP(C)Nos.5582-83/07

5

of

13

July,2007 is not subject matter of this appeal and
under challenge in this Court. We, therefore, give
permission to withdraw the appeal.
The appeal stands dismissed as withdrawn.”

6. Before we proceed further, it would be necessary to keep in mind the
nature of challenge posed by respondent no.3 in the LPA and Writ
Petition filed by it. The challenge of respondent no.3 in the LPA and
Writ Petition was predicated on Clause-6 of the tender conditions as per
which the bids offering highest discount were accepted. Submission of
respondent no.3 was that it had offered the highest discount of 5.4%
whereas the two petitioners herein had offered a discount of 3.1% only.
Respondent no.3 had also alleged that a group of shopkeepers have a pool
and influence on the allotment team and they do not allow any new
shopkeeper to enter in the supply chain. The reason given by respondent
no.2 in rejecting its bid was termed by the respondent no.3 as illegal and
arbitrary. As per respondent no.2, the envelop containing bid price was
not as per the format in terms of bid clause-3. It was further alleged that
audited documents submitted by the petitioner were also not signed on
each page of the documents submitted by him and, therefore, the bid was

WP(C)Nos.5582-83/07

6

of

13

not in accordance with Clause 24(v). Respondent no.3 had submitted that
there was no major lapse on its part. He also submitted that it was for this
reason that the Joint Secretary had advised that all cases having no major
lapse be reconsidered as it would affect the Government revenue.
7. While dismissing the writ petition, the learned Single Judge had observed
that though such advice was given by the Joint Secretary on 10.3.2006,
subsequently it was decided on 10.5.2006 that this suggestion is not to be
acceded to and was shelved and subsequently bid of the respondent no.3
remained ineligible.

When the matter came up in LPA before the

Division Bench, as pointed out above, after hearing these matters on
17.7.2007 the Division Bench expressed that “we are prima facie of the
opinion that rejection of the tender of the appellant on the alleged ground
is perverse”. This order further discloses that at that stage counsel for
respondents 1 and 2 had taken two days time to seek instructions and
ultimately two Office Memoranda each dated 19.7.2007 were issued
taking away one dispensary each from these two petitioners and allotting
the same to respondent no.3.
8. The position which emerges from the aforesaid discussion could be
summarized as under:
WP(C)Nos.5582-83/07

7

of

13

9. The discount offered by respondent no.3 in its bid was the maximum
i.e.5.4%. The two petitioners had initially offered a discount of 2.5%
which was increased to 3.1% subsequently.

Therefore, the discount

offered by respondent no.3 was much more than that of the two
petitioners and if the bid submitted by respondent no.3 was otherwise
proper and he was not to be rendered ineligible as per the tender terms,
respondent no.3 was entitled to allotment of all the four dispensaries in
Group XVIII. The alleged lapse in not submitting the bid in the proper
format was treated as minor. One of the Joint Secretaries, on this basis
had even suggested that such bids be reconsidered as otherwise revenue
loss to the Government would be substantial. The Division Bench on
17.7.2007 expressed prima facie opinion describing the decision of
rejection of the bid of respondent no.3 as `perverse' and gave an
opportunity to respondents 1 and 2 to take remedial steps themselves.
Such an opportunity was afforded to respondents 1 and 2 on the request
of their counsel as respondents 1 and 2 did not want any adverse
comments. Respondents 1 and 2, in these circumstances, took a decision
to take away the two dispensaries allotted to these two petitioners on
temporary basis so that these two are allotted to respondent no.3 (who
WP(C)Nos.5582-83/07

8

of

13

would have, in normal course, succeeded in getting allotment to all the
four dispensaries). One dispensary each to the two petitioners which
were allotted on regular basis were not touched by the respondents 1 and
2. This according to us is an equitable solution found by the respondents
1 and 2 in the given circumstances. The petitioners are continuing with
one dispensary each though they could have lost allotment to all the
dispensaries. Respondent no.3 also accepted and was satisfied with the
allotment of two dispensaries.
10.Faced with this situation, learned counsel for the petitioners submitted
that though the allotment of dispensaries at Dilshad Garden and Yamuna
Vihar was initially made on temporary basis, this was in fact regularized
on 6.7.2006. He buttressed this submission by referring to orders dated
20.9.2006 passed in

WP(C)No.14659-60/2006 wherein counsel for

respondents 1 and 2 had made a statement that the allotment of two
dispensaries was regularized. The order passed on that date was to the
following effect:
“Mr. Dalal has also pointed out that all the bids which
were found to be eligible in the first instance to whom
the temporary acceptance letters were issued have
been regularized on 06.07.2006 before the filing of the
present writ petition. According to him in absence of
WP(C)Nos.5582-83/07

9

of

13

M/s. Kailash Chemists and M/s. Jain Chemists whose
bids were regularized for group XVIII no such writ
order or directions can now be passed as has been
sought by the petitioner.”
The said order was challenged in LPA.No.1984/2006.
11. No doubt such a statement was made by counsel for respondents 1 and
2. However, veracity was questioned by learned counsel for respondent
no.3. In order to know the exact position, we summoned the records. We
also confronted Mr.Keshav Dayal, learned senior counsel who appeared
for respondents 1 and 2. Mr.Keshav Dayal was candid in his reply that
there were no such regularization and he submitted that it appears that
statement by the counsel was made in some mistaken belief. Even the
records show that there was no such regularization of these two
dispensaries allotted on temporary basis. In fact the record revealed that
many other dispensaries in various groups were allotted on temporary
basis, not only the two dispensaries in question which were allotted to the
two petitioners on temporary basis. Since allotment in favour of the
petitioners insofar as these two dispensaries are concerned was
temporary, the petitioners cannot even claim their right to continue with
this allotment. It is only for those dispensaries which were allotted on

WP(C)Nos.5582-83/07

10

of

13

31.3.2006 on regular basis that the duration of allotment is two years. As
far as these two dispensaries are concerned, no right has accrued in
favour of the petitioners.
12.As stated above, in the given scenario, cancelling their allotments in
favour of the petitioners to accommodate respondent no.3, who could
have been entitled to allotment of all the four dispensaries in Group
XVIII, cannot be treated as arbitrary or irrational but is most equitable.
Therefore, we are of the opinion that it is not a case which calls for
interference in exercise of our powers of judicial review under Article
226 of the Constitution of India.

We, therefore, dismiss these writ

petitions as devoid of any merit but leave the parties to bear their own
costs.
