1.

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
Following substantial question of law needs to be

answered :-

2.

Whether on the evidence on record the First
Appellate Court was justified in reversing the
judgment and decree passed by the learned
Trial Court?
The respondent filed a suit for injunction (mandatory

and prohibitory) against the appellant pleading that he owned
the ground floor flat bearing No.D-7/7033, Sector-D, Pockets 7
& 8, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi. That the flat was constructed by
DDA.

An open court yard formed part of the flat. As per the

office order issued by DDA he was entitled to lay a roof on the
FAO No.7/2001

page No.1 of 5

open court yard and construct a bath room and a WC.

Under

said right the open court yard was covered and a bathroom
and a WC was constructed.

Grievance made was that the

appellant who was the owner of the first floor flat was
threatening to raise construction on the roof constructed by
him to cover the open court yard. Prohibitory injunction was
prayed for to restrain the appellant to raise any construction
thereon. Further grievance made was that the appellant had
increased the size of his window which opened towards his
court yard.

Mandatory injunction was prayed for that the

appellant should be directed to restore the window to the
original size.
3.

Appellant alleged in the written statement that the

appellant had a right to increase the size of the window. That
the

constructions

raised

by

the

respondent

was

not

permissible. The appellant asserted a right to construct on the
roof erected by the plaintiff while covering the open court yard.
4.

Issue framed by the learned Trial Judge was whether

the plaintiff was entitled to the relief for permanent and
mandatory injunction.
5.

Since at the hearing held on 17.12.2007 learned

counsel for the respondent stated that the respondent does
not press the relief of mandatory injunction prayed for, I need
not decide on the said issue save and except to note that the
FAO No.7/2001

page No.2 of 5

relief of mandatory injunction prayed for is treated as
dismissed as withdrawn.
6.

On the issue of prohibitory injunction, an office order

dated 13.12.1996 issued by DDA was filed by the respondent
as also the appellant. The respondent i.e. plaintiff referred to
the said document

in his

testimony.

The document was

marked 'A'. The same very document was referred to by the
appellant in his testimony. It was exhibited as Ex.DW-1/2.
7.

But since neither party summoned any official

witness from DDA learned Trial Judge opined that the
document was not proved as per law.

Accordingly, learned

Trial Judge held that the plaintiff had failed to prove that he
could effect construction of a roof on the open court yard. It
was held that since the plaintiff had raised unauthorized
construction he could not seek any prohibitory relief against
the appellant.
8.

The suit was dismissed.

9.

The Appellate Court reversed the decision holding

that when both

the parties rely upon the same document

notwithstanding that the document is an official document,
same need not to be proved by summoning an official witness
for the reason the existence and contents of the document in
question is not in dispute. Holding that the office order Ex.DW1/2 was the common document filed by the parties and that it
FAO No.7/2001

page No.3 of 5

permitted constructions of a

bathroom and WC in the court

yard and also permitted covering of the open court yard,
learned Appellate Judge granted prohibitory injunction prayed
for the reason, appellant led no evidence to show that in law he
was entitled to raise construction on the roof in question.
10.

I find no infirmity in the view taken by the learned

Appellate Judge.
11.

Firstly, it has to be noted that the appellant did not

file any counter claim, much less prayed that the constructions
effected by the plaintiff should be demolished.

Thus, the

learned Trial Judge was not required to decide on the legality
and validity of the constructions effected by the respondent.
12.

Secondly, the only issue which had to be decided

was, whether the appellant had a right to effect constructions
on the roof laid by the plaintiff while covering the open court
yard.
13.

To succeed, appellant had to prove, through the

medium of the building bye laws or a notified policy of the
Government authorizing him to raise constructions on the roof
in question.
14.

Whereas plaintiff proved right to erect the roof by

and under the office order Ex.DW-1/2, though he was not
required to so prove, appellant failed to bring on record any
document where
FAO No.7/2001

from

a right in his

favour could

be

page No.4 of 5

established.
15.

The question of law framed is accordingly answered

by holding that in view of Ex.DW-1/2 the Appellate Court was
justified in reversing the judgment and decree passed by the
learned Trial Judge.
16.

Before concluding I may note that if any law

permits, after obtaining sanction from the authority concerned,
it would be open to the appellant to raise construction but the
same would be strictly in terms of sanction so obtained.
17.

Noting on record the concession made by learned

counsel for the respondent that the respondent gives up the
relief of mandatory injunction prayed for, the appeal stands
dismissed.
18.

No costs.
