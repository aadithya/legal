JUDGMENT
1.

This Writ Petition prays for the issuance of a writ of

Habeas Corpus or any other appropriate writ, order or Direction
quashing and setting aside the impugned order of detention
bearing F. No.801/11/97 PIT NDPS dated 24.2.1997 (Annexure
A hereto), issued by Shri R.K. Tewari, the Deputy Director
General (Co-ordination), Narcotics Control Bureau, New Delhi
the respondent No.2 herein against the petitioner Vimal Kumar

Behl under section 3(1) of the PIT NDPS Act 1988 and direct
that the petitioner be released from detention forthwith and be
set at liberty.

2.

The impugned Order is dated 24.2.1997 in which the

Deputy Director General (Coordination), Narcotics Control
Bureau considered it necessary, with a view to preventing the
Petitioner from engaging in the procurement, storage and
abetting in the export from India of narcotic drugs, to detain the
Petitioner and to keep him in custody in the Central Prison,
Pune. The grounds for detention of the Petitioner were
appended to the impugned Order and are of even date.
Identical Orders had been passed in respect of Shri Satya
Prakash

Behl,

the

only

variation

being

the

substitution/interchange of the names of these two persons at
the relevant part of the Order and Grounds of Detention.

3.

Shri Satya Prakash Behl had filed a Writ Petition in this

Court bearing Criminal Writ No.241/1997 which came to be
decided in his favour by Judgment dated 17.10.1997. The
Division Bench comprising Arun B. Saharya and J.B. Goel, JJ had
specifically

noted

WP(Crl.)923/2001

the

existence

of

some

audio

cassette

page 2 of 5

recording and the failure of the Respondents to provide copies
thereof, together with transcripts, to the Petitioner. The
argument, which has been raised before us, is that the audio
cassette was not a 'relied upon' document had not impressed
our learned Brothers. Relying on Smt. Shalini Soni -vs- Union of

India, AIR 1981 SC 431, Tushar Thakkar -vs- Union of India, AIR
1981 SC 436, S. Gurdip Singh -vs- Union of India, AIR 1981 SC
362, Mehdi Mohd. Zoudi -vs- State of Maharashtra, AIR 1981 SC
1752 and Kirti Kumar -vs- Union of India, AIR 1981 SC 1621 it
was held by the Division Bench that delay in complying with the
requirement invalidated the Detention. It was also opined that
the Detaining Authority had relied on earlier Orders as
additional inputs for arriving at its satisfaction, which was
impermissible. The Division Bench did not find favour with the
argument that where there are several grounds for Detention,
each one can be severed from the other and if anyone of them
can sustain or justify the detention, the unsatisfactory nature of
the others would not invalidate the Order. By a detailed
Judgment the Writ Petition of Shri Satya Prakash Behl was
allowed.

4.

Arguments, some of which are similar to those raised in

Criminal Writ No.241/1997, have been raised by Ms. Barkha
Babbar, learned counsel for the Respondents, including reliance
on Kamarunnissa -vs- Union of India, AIR 1991 SC 1640 which
holds inter alia that unless prejudice is pleaded and proved by
the Petitioner in respect of non-supply of any document, the
Detention Order would not be vitiated.

5.

In our opinion, the Writ Petition stands fully covered on all

fours by the decision of the Division Bench of this Court in
Criminal Writ No.241/1997 filed by Satya Prakash Behl. As we
have recorded at the commencement of this Judgment the
Detention Order as well as grounds of both persons are virtually
identical. We, therefore, find ourselves precluded from entering
into a consideration of precedents on which reliance has been
placed by the Respondents. This is for the simple reason that
Detention Orders of Shri Satya Prakash Behl as well as his
nephew, Shri Vimal Kumar Behl, the Petitioner before us, are,
for all intents and purposes, identical. Since Shri Satya Prakash
Behl has succeeded in his Writ Petition as far back as on
17.10.1997,

the

Petitioner

must

receive

the

same

jural

treatment. Mr. Sunil Mehta, learned counsel appearing for the

WP(Crl.)923/2001

page 4 of 5

Petitioner, states that a Special Leave Petition has been
preferred against the decision in Criminal Writ No.241/1997,
which was dismissed in limine.

Learned counsel for the

Respondents is unable to contradict that the said Judgment has
become final.

6.

In these circumstances the Writ Petition is allowed and

the impugned Order of Detention as well as Declaration under
Section 10 of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,
1988 is hereby quashed. Rule is made absolute. No costs.
