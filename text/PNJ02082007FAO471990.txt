PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Appellant

seeks

enhancement

of

compensation

on

account of injuries sustained by him in a road accident.
2.

Appellant was injured in a road accident on 1.12.1979,

involving car bearing No.DEA-2695.
3.

Since enhancement of compensation is prayed for and

there are no cross objections, I would only be noting facts
pertaining to the compensation assessed by the Tribunal in
favour of the appellant.
4.

Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.1,05,135.75 to the

appellant. Break up is as under :(a)

Loss of income during laid off period :

Rs. 7,135.75

(b)

Conveyance Expenses

Rs. 8,000/-

FAO No.47/1990

(c)

Future conveyance expenses

:

Rs. 20,000/-

(d)

Mental Shock, agony, special diet

:

Rs. 50,000/-

(e)

Loss of future prospects

:

Rs. 20,000/-

Total

:

Rs.1,05,135.75
5.

Age of the appellant as on the date of accident was 29

years. He was working as a Lecturer (Architecture) in Aryabhat
Polytechnic, G.T. Karnal Road, Delhi and was drawing a salary
of Rs.1500/- per month at the time of accident.
6.

On account of injuries sustained, appellant suffered a

compound fracture of neck of the right femur joint. The said
fracture mal-united resulting in shortening of the right lower
limb of appellant by 1 ½ inch.
7.

Period

of

treatment

spreads

over

different

dates,

spanning 2 years.
8.

I have before me the evidence of appellant being

admitted for surgery twice. Once, 16 days after the accident
and the other nearly 2 years thereafter. There are 2 spells of
hospitalization

spreading

over

4

months

and

23

days

respectively. I have also before me the statement of appellant
that he remained under follow up treatment.
9.

There is also evidence to show that leg of the appellant

never fully recovered.

Disability certificate dated 6.4.1988

issued by Safdarjung Hospital records that the appellant had
suffered

permanent

disability

to

the

extent

of

58%.

Dr.B.K.Dhawan who had treated the appellant in his testimony
as PW-3 had also deposed that appellant suffered a permanent
FAO No.47/1990

Page No.2 of 6

disability to the extent of 40%.

I also have before me the

statement of the appellant that he cannot run or squat on his
haunches.
10.

Learned

Counsel

for

the

appellant

challenges

the

quantum on two counts. One, that the award under the heads
'loss of salary for laid off period' and 'loss of future prospects' is
contrary to evidence led by the appellant.
11.

While recompensing appellant for 'loss of salary for laid

off period', learned Tribunal has taken note of only first spell of
his hospitalization. Tribunal has ignored that the appellant was
again hospitalized for second surgery on 10.11.1981 and was
discharged on 2.12.1981. I agree with the learned counsel for
the appellant that appellant needs to be recompensed for loss
of salary during second spell of hospitalization.

There is no

evidence to show salary of appellant in November 1981.
However, in the interest of justice, I award a further
compensation of Rs.1,426.75/- under the head 'loss of salary
during laid off period'.
12.

Future prospects of the appellant can be gauged from

following documents:“1.
Ex. PW-8/3 and Ex. PW-8/4: These are
the letters issued by the Netherland Government
evidencing that the appellant was offered fellowship
by the Netherland Government.

13.

2.
Ex. PW-8/5: This letter evidences that
appellant was offered a job as architect from
Mauritius Government at a salary of Rs.6,000/- per
month.”
However, because of injury sustained in the said accident,

appellant was not physically fit to accept the said offers. Thus,

FAO No.47/1990

Page No.3 of 6

there can be no doubt that said accident has badly marred the
future prospects of the appellant.

I enhance compensation

under the head 'loss of future prospects' from Rs.20,000/- to
Rs.50,000/-.
14.
that

From the evidence led by the appellant, it is apparent
in

the

instant

case

there

is

inadequacy

in

the

compensation awarded towards pain and suffering as also loss
of enjoyment of life.

I note that the compensation of

Rs.50,000/- awarded by the Tribunal under the head 'Mental
Shock, Agony and Special Diet' includes compensation for pain
and suffering also. I further note that compensation under the
head 'Loss of Enjoyment of Life' has been totally denied by the
Tribunal.
15.

Award under pain and suffering compensates an injured

person for the physical discomfort and emotional response to
the sensation of pain caused by the injury itself.

Pain is

physical; suffering is emotional. While pain is the physiological
response to certain stimuli, suffering is psychological or
emotional response to pain.
16.

There cannot be an absolute measure to determine

compensation for pain and suffering but, some guidance can
be

had

from

the

extent

of

injury

and

the

period

of

hospitalization coupled with the disability suffered.
17.

Noting that after the accident appellant was operated

upon twice as also the fact that he remained under treatment
for a intermittent period of 2 years, I consider it fair and
reasonable to enhance the compensation under the head
FAO No.47/1990

Page No.4 of 6

'mental shock, agony and special diet' from Rs.50,000/- to
Rs.70,000/-. I note that compensation is enhanced under this
head to adequately recompense the appellant for pain and
suffering undergone by the appellant on account of said
accident.
18.

Award for loss of enjoyment of life compensates for the

limitation, resulting from the defendant's negligence, on the
injured person's ability to participate in and derive pleasure
from the normal activities of daily life, or the individual's
inability to pursue his talents, recreational interests, hobbies or
avocations.

Thus, in essence, compensation for loss of

expectation of life compensates an injured person for loss of
quality of life or the value of life itself.
19.

No amount of money can recompense a person the loss

of enjoyment of pleasures of life. Every disability takes away
some pleasure of life or the other.
20.

Where a leg gets immobilized, a person suffers various

kinds of loss of pleasures of life. Free movement would be one.
21.

On account of loss of amenities and enjoyment of the

pleasures of life, noting the permanent disability suffered by
the appellant, I award him compensation in sum of Rs.20,000/-.
22.

Thus, total compensation payable is as follows:

(a)

Loss of income during laid off period :

Rs. 8,635.75

(b)

Conveyance Expenses

:

Rs. 8,000/-

(c)

Future conveyance expenses

:

Rs. 20,000/-

(d)

Mental Shock, agony, special diet

:

Rs. 70,000/-

(e)

Loss of future prospects

:

Rs. 50,000/-

23.

The enhanced compensation in sum of Rs.71,500/- shall

be paid to the appellant together with interest @ 7.5% p.a.
from date of claim petition till realization.
24.

Compensation would be payable by the respondents on

whom the liability has been fastened under the award.
25.

No costs.
