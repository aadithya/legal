1.
This appeal arises out of an order dated 2 nd
January, 2003 of the Commissioner Workmen's
Compensation awarding an amount of Rs.4,35,288/in favour of respondent No.1 for having suffered

total disability in the course of his

employment

as

driver

on

a truck

owned

by

respondent No.2.
2.

The respondent No.1 worked as a driver with
respondent No.2 on his truck bearing No.DL-IGB2809. On 21st July, 2001 he was proceeding on the
said truck from Delhi to Baroda. At about 5.30 p.m.
on that date, on reaching a place near Dadu, Jaipur
(Rajasthan) he parked his truck by the road side and
started crossing the road to go to the other side to
take refreshment when he was knocked down by a
speeding moped resulting into injuries all over his
body including

head.

He

was rushed to a

government hospital and later removed to
Chanan Devi Hospital, Delhi.

Mata

On account of head

injury he was rendered mentally disabled to work as a
driver. Such disability was to the extent of 100%. On
the relevant date the respondent No.1 was 35 years of
age and was drawing wages to the tune of Rs.3,000/plus Rs.50/- per day as allowances.

The vehicle in

question was at the relevant time insured with the
FAO No.163/2003

Page 2 of 14

appellant and an additional premium for liability
under

Workmen's

Compensation

Act

had

been

charged by it.

The respondent No.1 could not be served with
notice of appeal in ordinary course. He was ultimately

appearance either in person or through counsel.
was

respondent No.2 alone who, on being

It

served

with notice, contested the appeal.
4.

In his reply to the claim application, the
respondent No.2 admitted that respondent No.1 was
in his employment as a driver on the vehicle

in

question on the relevant date and time and that he
was drawing wages @ Rs.3,000/- plus Rs.50/- per
day as allowances.

He also admitted

that

the

accident as stated by respondent No.1 in his claim
application did take place on 21st July, 2001 while he
was on duty as driver on the said vehicle.
5.

The appellant contested the
grounds that

as the

claim on the

head injury resulting into

alleged 100% disablement to respondent No.1 did not
FAO No.163/2003

Page 3 of 14

arise out of use of the insured vehicle,

no liability

could be fastened on the appellant under Workmen's
Compensation Act. It was further pleaded that the
finding

of 100% permanent

disablement being not

based on any admissible medical

evidence, the

impugned order is liable to be set aside.
6.

I have heard learned counsel on either side.

7.

Learned counsel for the appellant assailed the
impugned order on the ground that under the motor
vehicle

policy

no

liability

under

Workmen's

Compensation Act could be created

against the

insurer unless the

injury to a

death or bodily

workman is caused by or arises out of use of the
insured vehicle in a public place. He contended that
since the head injury to respondent No.1 resulting
into alleged

100% permanent disablement did not

arise out of use of the insured vehicle, the appellant
could not be held liable to indemnify respondent No.2
for his liability towards respondent No.1 under the
Workmen's Compensation Act. According to the
learned counsel, in the facts of the given case, it is
FAO No.163/2003

Page 4 of 14

respondent No.2, being owner of the vehicle,

who

alone would be liable to compensate the respondent
No.1.
8.

Further, it was

argued that the respondent

No.1, in the course of his evidence, did not produce
any medical evidence in support of his plea that the
head injury suffered by him has resulted in alleged
100% permanent disablement.

It was pointed out

that a medical certificate was filed by the respondent
No.1 with his written arguments only which was not
got proved by examining the doctor concerned. The
Commissioner, Workmen's Compensation was, in the
circumstances, contended the learned

counsel, not

justified in taking judicial note of such medical
certificate.
certificate

Moreover, it was contended,

the medical

did not specify the percentage

of

disability, if any, suffered by respondent No.1 on
account of head injury and thus the Commissioner
Workmen's Compensation could not have based his
finding

of 100% permanent

disablement

on the
decision

of Andhra Pradesh High Court in Oriental Insurance
Company Ltd. Vs. Koningi Kondal & Ors.; I (2001)
ACC 232 was referred to lend assurance to his plea
that since the respondent No.1 failed to examine the
doctor concerned, who had issued the certificate in
question, such certificate could not have been taken
judicial note of.
9.

On behalf of respondent No.2 it was argued
with reference

to proviso to Section 147 (1) of the

Motor Vehicles Act requiring

a motor vehicle policy

thereunder to cover liability in respect of the death
or bodily injury to an employee arising under the
Workmen's Compensation Act, out of and in the
course of his employment while engaged in driving a
vehicle, it was contended that under Section 167 of
the Motor Vehicles Act where death or bodily injury
to a person gives rise to a claim for compensation
under that Act and also under the Workmen's
Compensation

Act

the

person

entitled

to

compensation has the option to claim compensation
under either of the two Acts but not under both.

In the context of first ground of challenge to

the impugned order no doubt

causal relationship

between the use of the motor vehicle and the accident
resulting

in

alleged

permanent

disablement

respondent No.1 was not direct and proximate,

to
the

accident was nevertheless connected with the use of
the motor vehicle in question. In

Shivaji Dayanu

Patil & Anr. Vs. Vatschala Uttam More (Smt);
(1991) 3 SCC 530 interpreting
“Arising out of”

occurring

the expression

in Section 92-A of the

Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 the Supreme Court says :
“This would show that as compared to the
expression “caused by”, the expression
“arising out of” has a wider connotation.
The expression “caused by” was used in
Sections 95(1)(b)(i) and (ii) and 96(2)(b)(ii) of
the Act. In Section 92-A, Parliament
however, chose to use the expression
“arising out of” which indicates that for the
purpose of awarding compensation under
Section 92-A, the casual relationship
between the use of the motor vehicle and
the accident resulting in death or
permanent disablement is not required to
be direct and proximate and it can be less
immediate. This would imply that accident
should be connected with the use of the
motor vehicle but the said connection need
FAO No.163/2003

Page 8 of 14

not be direct and
immediate.
This
construction of the expression “arising out
of the use of a motor vehicle” in Section 92A enlarges the field of protection made
available to the victims of an accident and is
in consonance with the beneficial object
underlying the enactment.”
11.

In a later decision in Smt. Rita Devi & Ors. Vs.

New India Assurance Co. Ltd.; AIR 2000 Supreme
Court 1930 the law as laid down in Shivaji Dayanu's
case (supra) finds reiteration. It was a case where an
auto rickshaw registered as a public carrier vehicle,
was hired by some unknown passengers. Later, the
said auto rickshaw was reported stolen and the dead
body of driver of that auto rickshaw was recovered
by the police on the next day.

The auto rickshaw

however, could not be recovered and the claim of the
owner for the loss of auto rickshaw was accepted by
the insurance company and settled amount for loss
suffered by the owner was paid to him. For the death
of the driver on a claim for compensation being filed,
the Motor Accident Claims Tribunal,
analysis, held the

driver. Accordingly, the

Tribunal awarded a sum of Rs.2,81,500/- against the
insurance company with interest @12% per annum
from the date of application till payment.

On an

appeal being preferred before the High Court by the
insurance company, the
reversed

Tribunal's decision was

holding that as it was a case

of murder

and not of accident, a claim petition under the Motor
Vehicles Act would not lie. In appeal against such

for

the insurance company sought to

the judgment

of the

High

Court

by

contending that on the facts of the case the death of
the driver of the auto rickshaw was caused

by

acts of certain unknown persons and the

same was not caused by an accident arising out of
the use of the vehicle. This argument however did
not find favour

with the

Supreme Court and the

same was negatived. It was held on facts of that case
that the murder of the deceased auto rickshaw driver
was attributable to an accident arising out of the use
of motor vehicle and therefore

the claimants were

unacceptable.
12.

As far as the other ground of challenge is

concerned, it is noticed

that respondent No.1 had

adduced evidence in support of claim by way of his
affidavit. Apart from his own statement on affidavit,
FAO No.163/2003

Page 11 of 14

the respondent No.1 appears to have had produced
no medical evidence to prove that he suffered 100%
permanent

disability

for

the

purpose

of

his

employment as a driver. A medical certificate dated
9/16th March, 2002 from one Dr. Munish Aggarwal of
Mata Chanan Devi Hosptial, Delhi is there on record
which reads thus :
“

TO WHOM SO EVER IT MAY CONCERN
This is to certify that Sh. Dhram Pal S/o
Sh. Kashi Ram Age 35 years, is not fit for
driving any vehicle as he suffering from
head injury.

certificate

was

not

examined by the respondent No.1 to prove the same
and thus the appellant did not get an opportunity of
cross examining that doctor in regard to the nature
and extent of disablement of respondent No.1 on
account of

his head injury.

In the circumstances,

Commissioner Workmen's Compensation was not
FAO No.163/2003

Page 12 of 14

justified in taking into account and basing his finding
of 100% permanent

disablement to the respondent

No.1 on the said medical certificate. The impugned
order is, in the circumstances, liable to be set aside
on this count.
13.

In the result, the appeal is allowed and the
order dated 2nd January, 2003 of the

impugned

Commissioner Workmen's Compensation is set aside.
The

is

Commissioner

Workmen's Compensation with a direction to require

the nature and extent

of disablement, if any, on

account of his head injury. On such evidence being
produced,

application afresh in the light of admissible evidence
