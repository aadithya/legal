This petition has been filed under Section 276 of the Indian

Succession Act by Ms. Reba Kapur seeking probate of the last Will
and testament dated 29th September, 2000 made by late Justice
Dilip Kumar Kapur. As per the list of relatives filed on record,
apart from the petitioner who is the widow of the deceased
testator, the deceased is succeeded by one daughter Ms. Sheboo

In answer to the notice which was issued to her, Ms.

Test.Cas. 33/2006

page 1 of 5

Sheboo Kapur has filed an affidavit dated 19th July, 2006 whereby
she has deposed that she has read the last Will and testament
made by her deceased father and also the present probate petition.
Ms. Sheboo Kapur has further deposed that she has no objection
to the grant of the probate of the Will to the petitioner.
2.

Citation of the filing and pendency of the present petition

was published in The Statesman dated 15th July, 2006 inviting
objections from the public however no objections have been
received.
3.

So far as proof of execution of the Will is concerned, the

petitioner has filed the affidavit as well as affidavits of the two
attesting witnesses. The Will dated 29th September, 2000 was
signed and executed by the deceased in the presence of Shri Rajiv
Dhawan and Shri Dalbir K. Kapur. The two attesting witnesses
have filed affidavits submitting that the Will dated 29th September,
2000 was executed by late Justice Dilip Kumar Kapur in their
presence and that they had affixed their signatures thereupon in
witness of the execution of the Will. The original Will dated 29th
September, 2000 has been filed on record and has been proved in
the statement of Ms. Reba Kapur as Exhibit B.
4.

It has also come in the evidence of the petitioner that Justice

Test.Cas. 33/2006

page 2 of 5

Dilip K. Kapur (Retd.) unfortunately expired at Delhi on 25th
October, 2000.

The death certificate

in this behalf has been

placed on record and marked Exhibit A. The deceased testator
was a Hindu at the time of his death and in terms of the Schedule
to the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. He is succeeded by his widow
Ms. Reba Kapur the petitioner in the present case and their only
daughter Ms. Sheboo Kapur as the only heir in class I. Even as per
the bequest made in Exhibit B, the last Will and testament dated
29th September, 2000, the petitioner and her daughter Ms. Sheboo
Kapur are the only beneficiaries.
5.

The petitioner has also proved on record that in compliance

with the requirement of the Will she has opened a bank account in
the name of Sheboo Kapur with the Bank of Baroda, Bharat Nagar
Branch bearing account no. 20011976 and has deposited a sum of
Rs.20 lakhs only in the bank account in the month of September,
2006 as per the condition in the Will.
6.

In this view of the matter the petitioner has established the

execution of the Will dated 29th September, 2000 by late Justice
Dilip K. Kapur as his last Will and testament. There is no
impediment consequently to the grant of the prayer in the petition
whereby probate thereof has been sought.

7.

Accordingly, I allow this petition and grant probate of the

last Will and testament dated 29th September, 2000 executed by
late Justice Dilip K. Kapur to the petitioner with the Will attached.
Inasmuch as there is no contest to the present petition, it is
directed that the probate shall be issued subject to furnishing of an
Administration bond only.
8.

The petitioner in this petition has prayed that inasmuch as

the immovable property which was the subject matter of the Will
stands transferred to the name of the beneficiary under the Will,
probate is being sought only in respect of the moveable properties
that is the shares, mutual funds including dividend and interest
and the bank account which has been detailed in para 2 of the
petition. In this behalf in support of the maintainability of such a
prayer, learned counsel for the petitioner has placed reliance on a
pronouncement of this court reported at AIR 2003 Delhi 137
Jasbir Singh Khanna v. State & Ors. I find that in this case
it was held that even though other properties may also be the
subject matter of the Will, probate can be granted of the moveable
property alone which may be the subject matter of the Will.
9.

In the light of the principles applied in AIR 2003 Delhi

137 Jasbir Singh Khanna v. State & Ors., it is directed that
Test.Cas. 33/2006

page 4 of 5

the petitioner shall be liable to pay court fee only on the value of
the properties detailed in schedule A, B, C and D which have been
totalled as per para 13 of the affidavit being a total of Rs.2,17, 38,
958.18 paise only.
This petition is allowed in the above terms.
