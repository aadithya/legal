1.

The petitioner has sought quashing of office order dated 23rd

March, 1996 relieving the petitioner on afternoon of 23rd March, 1996,
(24th being Sunday) from Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd and a direction
to respondent No.1 to reinstate the petitioner in the services and pay
the salaries and allowances after correcting his date of birth from 8th
March, 1938 to 9th March, 1939 as recorded with the respondent
No.1.

2.

The petitioner has contended that he did his matriculation from

WP(C) 1786 of 1989

Page 1 of 11

Punjab University in the examination held on March 1995 and a
matriculation examination certificate was issued to him where his
date of birth was recorded as 8th March, 1938.

3.

According to him, his date of birth was recorded wrongly in the

school on account of clerical mistake while converting the date of
birth recorded in Vikrami Era (Hindi Calendar) to Esvi Era (English
Calendar) on admission of the petitioner in a different school for his
matriculation examination. After completing his schooling from
Punjab University, the petitioner joined as a Overseer Electrical after
passing Diploma in Electrical Engineering from University of Rurki,
Rurki. According to the petitioner, in March 1989 one of his friends
while flipping through his school record told him that his date of birth
recorded as 25th Phagun, 1995 (Vikrami Era) in the transfer certificate
of 8th class issued by A.V. Middle School, Gharuan, District Ropar,
Punjab, does not tally with the date of birth recorded as 8 th March,
1938 on conversion to English Calendar in the admission form to the
10th class of

Khalsa High School, Kurali, District Ropar, Punjab.

According to the petitioner, on conversion his date of birth should
have been 9th March, 1939 and not 8th March, 1938 which mistake
was inadvertently committed by the concerned school.

4.

It is averred that the petitioner thereafter applied to Punjab

University by letter dated 27th April, 1989 for correction of his date of
birth in the matriculation certificate issued to him. The Punjab
University ultimately alleged to have issued a letter dated 4th
December, 1994 asking the petitioner to submit an application form
along with Rs.1000/- which was complied with by the petitioner and
ultimately the petitioner was issued a corrected Punjab University
Matriculation Certificate dated 13th March, 1996 indicating his date of
birth as 9th March, 1939 in place of 8th March, 1938.

5.

The petitioner is alleged to have also requested the respondent

No.1 to correct his date of birth in their records by a communication
dated 25th November, 1994. He also forwarded the corrected
matriculation certificate to the concerned AGM (P&A) of respondent
No.1 by his letter dated 14th March, 1996 pursuant to a letter from
respondent No.1 dated 30th January, 1996 communicating to the
petitioner that unless a corrected certificate is submitted by the
petitioner at least two weeks in advance, the petitioner shall be retired
from the services on 24th March, 1996 as per the date of birth
recorded in the records.

6.

The petition was filed by the petitioner on 2nd July, 1996 after

WP(C) 1786 of 1989

Page 3 of 11

he was retired from the service by letter dated 23rd March, 1996. The
respondent No.1 has contested the petition contending that the last
post held by the petitioner was that of a Deputy General Manager. He
had joined the services of respondent No.1 on 10th June, 1963 as
Overseer and furnished his date of birth as 8th march, 1938.

The

petitioner is an educated person with Diploma in Engineering and he
took no steps for almost 30 years to have his date of birth changed. In
the circumstances, it is contended by the respondent No.1 that after
he has been correctly superannuated on 24th March,1996, the
petitioner is not entitled for change of date of birth nor he is entitled
for any benefit which may accrue on account of change of his date of
birth.

Regarding the cases of Pritam Singh and Surinder Singh, it

was contended that they had no certificates and correction in their
dates of birth were made well in time. In any case, it was contended
that Mr.Pritam Singh as per his corrected date of birth had to retire in
the year 2000 and Mr.Surinder Singh is due for retirement in 2003
and their cases are different from that of the petitioner. Regarding the
case of Daya Singh, it was contended that no change has been made
in the date of birth of Daya Singh. In the circumstances, it is
contended that there is no discrimination with the petitioner. The
petitioner was promoted as Deputy General Manager on 25th June,
1994 and his next promotion, if any, could have been due only in

WP(C) 1786 of 1989

Page 4 of 11

June 1997 and in the circumstances, it is contended that the date of
birth of the petitioner could not be changed and he has already retired
and even on the basis of his alleged change of date of birth, he cannot
be inducted in service and no emoluments can be paid to the
petitioner for the period he has not worked merely on the basis of
alleged change of date of birth.

7.

I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner in detail and

have perused the writ petition, reply filed on behalf of the respondent
no.1. No one has appeared on behalf of the respondents. The
emphasis of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that the change
in date of birth was sought on account of clerical error which
appeared on account of transferring the date of birth in the school
from Hindi Calendar month to English Calendar Month. It is not
disputed that the petitioner did his matriculation in 1955 and a
certificate was issued to him showing his date of birth as 8th March,
1938. This is not the case of the petitioner that when the
matriculation certificate of Punjab University was issued to him 1955,
he did have his birth certificate of 8th class showing his date of birth

During all this time the petitioner had his

certificate giving the Hindi Calendar month with him. The petitioner
being an educated person ought to have known that his date of birth
is not allegedly in consonance with his Hindi date of birth. Nothing
has been produced by the petitioner to show his Hindi date of birth.

8.

This is no more res integra that a Government official or an

educated employee cannot be allowed to change his date of birth at
the fag end of his career.

Though the learned counsel for the

petitioner has contended that the petitioner did not seek change of his
date of birth at the fag end of his career as he had applied to Punjab
University in 1989 and since the Punjab University took considerable
time, therefore, the petitioner could apply to the respondent No.1 for
change of date of birth in 1994. The plea of the petitioner that he did
not apply for change of date of birth at the fag end of his career
cannot be accepted in the facts and circumstances of the present
case. The petitioner joined the services of the respondent no.1 in 1963
and he retired in 1996. Even if he applied to the Punjab University in
1989, it will be fag end of his career. The petitioner applied to the
respondent

no.1

in

1994

and

sent

the

corrected

matriculation certificate just days before the retirement. Since the
petitioner was employed with the respondent No.1 on 10th June, 1963,

WP(C) 1786 of 1989

Page 6 of 11

the demand for change of date of birth in 1994 after a service of about
31 years, which is two years before the retirement in 1996, in the
facts and circumstances, has to be construed as demanding change of
date of birth at the fag end of the career which cannot be permitted in
the facts and circumstances.

9.

Learned counsel for the petitioner has also emphasized on the

letter dated 30th January, 1996 by respondent No.1 demanding that
the matriculation certificate with corrected date of birth be submitted
two weeks before the retirement so as to carry out the change of date
of birth. Learned counsel has contended that this amount to estoppel
on the part of the respondent No.1. Admittedly,

the

petitioner

had

retired on 24th March, 1996 whereas the alleged corrected certificate
with changed date of birth was sent on 14th March, 1996 which was
not in consonance with the tenor of the letter dated 30th January,
1996 which demanded that the letter for change of birth be submitted
at least two weeks in advance. In any case in the facts and
circumstances and the established law, the petitioner cannot seek
change of date of birth on the basis of alleged estoppels.

10.

The importance of the date of birth of an employee given to his

employer and accepted as correct by the later and entered in the” Ser-

WP(C) 1786 of 1989

Page 7 of 11

vice and Leave record” of the former, cannot be underestimated. When
a person is taken into service on appointment, he is required to declare his date of birth and produce a document in support there of.
When on the basis of such declaration made or certificate produced
by the employee, an entry is made of his date of birth in his record
and there is no error on the part of the officials, then the Government
or the employer at the fag end of the career of such employee, can decline to change the date of birth. Changing the date of Birth in exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, in
such facts and circumstances is unwarranted. Extra ordinary nature
of the jurisdiction vested in the High Court’s under Article 226 of the
Constitution of India is not meant to make employees of the Government or its instrumentalities to continue service beyond the period of
their entitlement according to the date of birth accepted by such employers on the basis of such newly found material or to grant relief regarding emoluments on the basis of such change of date of Birth. The
Supreme Court in U.P. Madhyamik Shiksha Parishad v. Raj Kumar Agnihotri,(2005) 11 SCC 465 , at page 475 had held that the service
record cannot be changed just a few years before the retirement or at
the fag end of his retirement. The Apex Court had held as under :
“……It is thus seen from the above quoted judgments that
this Court has consistently taken the view that correction
in entries made in government records on the basis of

WP(C) 1786 of 1989

Page 8 of 11

which the government servant got the service cannot be
allowed to be changed just a few years before retirement
or at the fag end of his retirement.

11.

The Supreme Court had also held in Union of India v. Harnam

Singh, (1993) 2 SCC 162 that the alteration sought by an employee 35
years after his induction into service during which he had several occasions to see the service book cannot be allowed. The Supreme Court
had held as under :
“ ………In this case, there was a delay of five years in
seeking for alteration prescribed in Note 5 to FR 56( m )
as substituted in 1979. This Court held that those already in service prior to 1979, for a period of more than
five years, obliged to seek alteration within the maximum
period of five years from the date of coming into force of
amended Note 5 in 1979. Alteration sought by the employee in 1991, 35 years after his induction into the service during which period he had several occasions to see
the service-book to raise any objection regarding his date
of birth cannot be allowed in view of unexplained and inordinate delay.”

12.

This is not disputed by the petitioner that the entry in the ser-

vice record was made on the basis of Matriculation certificate produced by him. There was no mistake in the entry made on the basis
of the certificate produced by him. The school certificate on the basis
of which, the change of date of birth is sought by the petitioner had
always been with him. The change of date of birth is not on the basis
of some new material discovered by him.

WP(C) 1786 of 1989

The authenticity of the

Page 9 of 11

school certificate on the basis of which Matriculation certificate was
got changed by the Punjab University has not been produced. The
change of date of birth in the Matriculation certificate by the University almost after thirty three years will not bind the Employer to change
the date of birth of the petitioner.

13.

In Commissioner of Police, Bombay VS Bhagwan V. Lahane,

(1991) 1 SCC 247, the Apex Court had observed as under:
“….It appears that he got the entry in the birth register
corrected, then obtained a copy of it and produced the
same before the authority. Once it was found to be
doubtful, the authorities were right in not correcting his
date of birth in the service-book. Admittedly, the School
Leaving Certificate was produced by the respondent and
the entry in the service-book was made on the basis of
the date of birth mentioned therein. As he failed to show
that the said entry was made due to want of care on the
part of some other person or that it was an obvious
clerical error, the Tribunal ought not to have directed the
appellant to correct the same. “

14.

For the foregoing reasons, there are no grounds to quash the

letter dated 23rd March, 1996 retiring the petitioner from the afternoon of 23rd March, 1996 nor there is any ground to direct the respondent No.1 to change the date of birth. The petitioner has already
retired and the period for which he would have worked more in case

WP(C) 1786 of 1989

Page 10 of 11

his date of birth could be changed has also expired without petitioner
doing any work during this period. Consequently there is no ground
to award any monetary benefit to the petitioner for this period. The
petitioner is not entitled for any amount as his date of birth cannot be
allowed to be changed in the record of the respondent no.1.

15.

The writ petition, in the facts and circumstances, is without any

merit and is, therefore, dismissed. The parties are, however, left to
bear their own costs.
