1.

The petitioner has impugned the award dated 20th August, 2005

dismissing the claim of the petitioner that he was terminated illegally
and unjustifiably on the ground that the petitioner failed to prove that
he had worked with the management for more than 240 days of
continuous service.

2.

The petitioner had raised an industrial dispute against the

respondent that his services were terminated illegally and pursuant to
industrial dispute being raised by the petitioner, the appropriate
government made a reference under Section 10(1)(c) and 12(5) of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 by order dated 30th September, 2003.
The following reference was made:
“Whether the services of Sh.Raj Kumar S/o Illam Chand
have been terminated illegally and/or unjustifiably by the
management, and if so, to what relief is he entitled and
what directions are necessary in this respect?”

3.

The petitioner alleged that he was in the services of the

management since 1982 as a “Foreman” and his last drawn salary was
Rs.4,600/- per month and he was illegally terminated by the
management on 16th July, 2002.

4.

No one appeared on behalf of respondent/management and

consequently the respondent was proceeded ex parte.

5.

The Labour Court held that though the petitioner filed his

evidence on affidavit and also exhibited documents Ex.WW1/1 to
Ex.WW1/7, however, none of the documents filed by the workman
showed that the petitioner worked for more than 240 days in a year.

The learned Labour Court relying on the judgment of the

Supreme Court in The Range Forest Officer v. S T Hardimani, (2002) 3
SCC 25, held that the onus was on the petitioner to prove that he
worked for more than 240 days in one calendar year preceding his
termination and, therefore, it could not be inferred that the services of
the petitioner were terminated illegally and, therefore, dismissed the
reference, however, the petitioner was granted a sum of Rs.15,000/- as
cost of litigation.

7.

The petitioner has impugned the award dated 20th August, 2005

and even in the writ petition, the respondent/management had not
appeared despite service and was proceeded ex parte on 14th November,
2007. The learned counsel for the petitioner has contended that after
terminating the services illegally on 16th July, 2002, and after the award
dated 20th August, 2005, the workman has since been again employed
by the respondent.

Learned counsel for the petitioner, in the

circumstances, prayed for the back wages only.

8.

From a perusal of the evidence of the petitioner and the

documents, copies of which have been produced by the petitioner, it
appears that none of the documents produced by the petitioner show
that the petitioner has worked for more than 240 days in a calendar
year preceding his termination.

On the basis of a letter dated 25th
Page 3 of 6

August, 1999 by the management to the Employee State Corporation
and the identity card of the petitioner, it cannot be inferred that the
petitioner had worked for more than 240 days in a calendar year
preceding the date of his termination so as to infer that the alleged
termination is in violation of Section 25 F of Industrial Disputes Act,
1947. The Apex Court in Range Forest Officer v. S.T. Hadimani,(2002) 3
SCC 25, at page 25 had held as under :
“………….In our opinion the Tribunal was not right in
placing the onus on the management without first
determining on the basis of cogent evidence that the
respondent had worked for more than 240 days in the year
preceding his termination. It was the case of the claimant
that he had so worked but this claim was denied by the
appellant. It was then for the claimant to lead evidence to
show that he had in fact worked for 240 days in the year
preceding his termination. Filing of an affidavit is only his
own statement in his favour and that cannot be regarded as
sufficient evidence for any court or tribunal to come to the
conclusion that a workman had, in fact, worked for 240
days in a year. No proof of receipt of salary or wages for 240
days or order or record of appointment or engagement for
this period was produced by the workman. On this ground
alone, the award is liable to be set aside.

9.

If the claim of the petitioner was that he worked for 240 days in a

year preceding his termination, it was for the petitioner to lead adequate
evidence and an affidavit only in support of this contentions will not be
sufficient. Learned counsel for the petitioner is unable to show any
evidence on the basis of which it can be inferred that the petitioner
worked for more than 240 days in a calendar year preceding date of
termination of the petitioner.

The findings and inferences of the Labor Court are based on lack

of evidence on the part of the petitioner and there does not appear to be
any manifest errors in them. This court in exercise of its jurisdiction
under article 226 of Constitution of India is not to substitute its own
inferences with the inferences drawn by the Labor Court as drawn on
the basis of material on record. In (2006) 2 SCC 373 , at page 378 Govt.
of A.P. v. Mohd. Nasrullah Khan the Supreme court had held:

11. By now it is a well-established principle of law that the
High Court exercising power of judicial review under Article
226 of the Constitution does not act as an appellate
authority. Its jurisdiction is circumscribed and confined to
correct errors of law or procedural error, if any, resulting in
manifest miscarriage of justice or violation of principles of
natural justice. Judicial review is not akin to adjudication
on merit by reappreciating the evidence as an appellate
authority.

11.

Thus it is a settled position of law that in exercise of jurisdiction

under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, the High Court is not to
interfere with factual findings of the lower courts and should restrain
itself from re-appreciating evidence while exercising powers of judicial
review.

Writ court is not to interfere with the orders of an inferior

tribunal or subordinate court unless their order suffers from an error of
jurisdiction or from a breach of the principles of natural justice or is
vitiated by a manifest or apparent error of law. The objective of judicial
review is that a person receives a fair treatment and objective is not to
WP(C) 19223 of 2006

Page 5 of 6

re-appreciate the entire pleas and evidence and draw inferences again.
Judicial review is not an appeal from a decision but a review of the
manner in which the decision is made. Power of judicial review is meant
to ensure that the individual receives fair treatment and not to ensure
that the conclusion which the authority reaches is necessarily correct in
the eye of the court.

12.

The finding of the Labor Court that the petitioner has failed to

show that he worked for 240 days in the year preceding his termination
does not have any manifest error as the Learned counsel is unable to
show any evidence on the basis of which it can be inferred that the
petitioner worked for 240 days in the year preceding his termination. In
the circumstances, there is no manifest error or an error apparent in
the award dated 20th August, 2005 so as to exercise jurisdiction under
Article 226 of the Constitution of India against the award dated 20th
August, 2005 impugned by the petitioner. The writ petition in the facts
and circumstances is without any merit and is, therefore, dismissed.
