ANIL KUMAR, J. (Oral)

1.

The petitioner has challenged the award dated 29th August,

2004 holding that the termination of the services of the respondent
No.2/workman was illegal and, therefore, directing reinstatement of
the workman with 50% back wages and continuity of services and all
other legal benefits.
2.

After the reference was made to the Labour Court, statement of

claim was filed. Written statement was filed by the petitioner taking
various objections including that the Conciliation Officer never gave

opportunity to the Management in the conciliation proceedings and
that no demand notice was served upon the Management.
3.

The issues were framed on 7th February, 2002, however,

thereafter the Management failed to appear on 20th January, 2003
and was proceeded ex parte. The award was given on 29th August,
2004. From 20th January, 2003 no one appeared on behalf of the
petitioner on various dates nor any one appeared to argue the matter
before the Labour Court.
4.

The Labour Court after considering the documents and evidence

on record passed an award dated 29th August, 2004 against the
petitioner. Aggrieved by the said award, the present petition has been
filed by the petitioner. However, in the writ petition filed by the
petitioner, no sufficient cause has been made out for non-appearance
of the petitioner/Management or its authorized representative on 20th
January, 2003 when ex-parte proceedings were initiated against the
petitioner or for subsequent dates.

The allegation has rather been

made by the petitioner against the authorized representative that he
did not discharge himself properly from conducting the proceedings.
The petitioner has failed miserably to show as to what was done on
behalf of petitioner to enquire from the authorized representative as to
what was done on various dates when the matter was listed before the
Labour Court.

5.

The petitioner was proceeded ex parte on 20th January, 2003

and the matter was taken up thereafter on 7th March, 2003; 9th May,
2003 and on various dates thereafter, the details of which are not
given by the petitioner. The allegations as made by the petitioner do
not constitute sufficient cause for setting aside the ex parte award
against the petitioner.
6.

In the facts and circumstances, no manifest error or error

apparent from the record can be inferred from the award dated 29 th
August, 2004 and the ex-parte proceedings taken against the
petitioner. The award is based on un-rebutted testimony of the
workman and the documents produced and proved by him. There is
no perversity or manifest error or denial of principles of natural
justice to the petitioner.
7.

The writ petition, in the facts and circumstances, is without any

merit and is, therefore, dismissed.

January 23, 2008.
