PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

On 14.3.2008 in presence of the appellant and

noting that his counsel was stated to be not available, matter
was re-notified for today clearly informing the appellant that no
further adjournment would be granted.

One M.P.Gupta who

claims to be a friend of the appellant Ramesh Chand Sachdeva
is present in Court and states that Ramesh Chand Sachdeva
has told him to inform the Court that his counsel Mr.O.P.Verma,
Advocate is not available today.

2.

I am not inclined to adjourn the matter for the

reason appellant has managed to have the Trial Court record
summoned in this Court and has not shown any keenness
thereafter to argue the matter.

I note that the respondent

Ms.Lovleen is a widow.
3.

According to Ms.Lovleen, late Mr.Bishamber Dass

was blessed with 3 sons namely Ramesh Chand Sachdeva, Ved
Prakash Sachdeva and K.K.Sachdeva.

Unfortunately for him,

his son K.K.Sachdeva had pre-deceased him.
wife of K.K.Sachdeva.

Lovleen is the

Lovleen predicated a Will dated

26.2.1986 purportedly executed by her father-in-law.

She

succeeded in establishing the Will which I note vis-a-vis
execution thereof was not really a matter of dispute between
the parties.

The Will in question, a registered document

proved as Ex.PW-1/1 shows the concern of the grandfather
towards his grandchildren i.e. sons of late K.K.Sachdeva.
4.

Probate sought by Mr.Lovleen was objected to by

Ramesh Chand Sachdeva and none else. It has to be noted in
the impugned order that the wife of the deceased consented to
the grant of the probate.
5.

The objector set up a will dated 21.11.1995.

The

said will was claimed to be attested by 2 witnesses namely
Jitender Kumar Verma examined as RW-3 and one Mahesh
FAO.No.212/04

page 2 of 5

Kumar examined as RW-4.
6.

RW-4, Mahesh Kumar who appeared as the witness

of the objector on 17.12.2003 lost courage in the Court.
Probably, he was overwhelmed by the authority of the Court.
He was hesitating in answering the questions. He blurted out
that he was actually Sanjay Aggarwal S/o Chandu Lal Aggarwal
and he has impersonated by masquerading as Mahesh Kumar.
A part of the cross-examination of RW-4 has been noted by the
learned Trial Judge. I reproduce the same:“...........I do not have any proof of identity that I am
Mahesh Kumar S/o Shri Rukmesh Kumar.
Question : Can you give the name of your wife?
(The demeanour of the witness is noted as he is taking
too much of time in disclosing the name of his wife
and the question has to be repeated.)
Answer : The name of my wife is Madhu.
(At this stage, it is submitted by the witness that if he
is pardoned he may be permitted to tell the truth. He
has submitted that he is not real Mahesh Kumar. He
has stated that his real name is Sanjay Aggarwal S/o
Shri Chandu Lal Aggarwal R/o WB-138, Ganesh Nagar,
Gali No.7, Shahdara, Delhi.)”
7.

The learned Trial Judge has thus held that there is a

serious doubt cast on the due execution of the will dated
21.11.1995.
8.

That apart, the objector i.e. the appellant had

admitted receipt of a legal notice dated 26.9.1995 from his
FAO.No.212/04

page 3 of 5

father. The legal notice has been proved as Ex.PW-3/2. The
legal notice has been sent under instructions of the testator
wherein the testator has warned his son not to extend threats
to him i.e. the testator, the testator's wife, the testator's
widowed daughter-in-law and his 2 grandsons, the principal
beneficiaries of the will dated 26.2.1986.
9.

Considering the contemporaneous evidence and

specially Ex.PW-3/2 which shows strained relations between
the

appellant

and

his

father,

additionally

noting

the

impersonation of a stated attesting witness to the will
propounded by the appellant the learned Trial Judge has held
that the will propounded by the appellant is not duly proved.
10.

Pertaining to the will dated 26.2.1986 Ex.PW-1/1

learned Trial Judge has noted that the objection was predicated
on the alleged subsequent Will without actually challenging the
due execution of the Will Ex.PW-1/1. It has additionally been
noted that through the testimony of the witnesses the Will in
question, Ex.PW-1/1, has been established.
11.

For my purposes, suffice would it be to record that if

on the given evidence the view taken by the learned Trial
Judge is a plausible view, this Court would not re-appreciate
the evidence to find the relative strength of the contra view
vis-a-vis the view taken.
FAO.No.212/04

page 4 of 5

12.

Even otherwise, on the given evidence the only view

possible is that the Will propounded by the appellant is a
fabricated Will.
13.

The only view possible is that the Will propounded

by Lovleen is the last valid and legal testament of the
deceased.
14.

The appeal is dismissed.

15.

Costs shall follow.

16.

TCR be returned forthwith.
