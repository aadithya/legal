(Oral)

This is a petition under Section 11(6) of the Arbitration &

Conciliation Act for appointment of an arbitrator.

2.

The petitioner contended that it is a company incorporated

under the Indian Companies Act and is engaged in the business of
providing financial /credit facilities in the form of auto loans, personal
loans and home equity loans etc. to its customers and that the

petition has been filed by Ms. Shalini Saxena, Assistant Manager, D/o
Mr.S.N. Saxena, R/o F-57, Bhagat Singh Market, New Delhi-1 who
has been authorized by a Power of attorney dated 5 th August, 2004 to
sign, verify and institute the present petition.

3.

The petitioner contended that the respondent nos.1 and 2

applied to the petitioner for loan against immovable property and a
loan of Rs.18,50,000/- along with interest @ 17% per annum was
sanctioned to the respondents repayable in 120 equal monthly
installments of Rs.32153/- each and that the first payment was due
for 1st June, 2003.

4.

In view of the loan granted by the petitioner various documents

such as the promissory note, loan agreement, declaration and power
of attorney, were executed by the respondents. Also in order to secure
repayment of the loan amount along with interest and other charges
an equitable mortgage was created by the respondent with respect to
the immovable property bearing no.5, first floor, Dheeraj Appts, Ogad
Bhai Lane, Ghatkopar, East Mumbai, Maharashtra and the title deeds
in respect of the property were deposited by respondent with the
petitioner company.

5.

According to the petitioner the respondents failed to adhere to

AA No.241/2006

Page 2 of 6

the repayment schedule and defaulted in making payment of the
installments as the post dated cheques issued by the respondents for
repayment of the loan amount with interest were returned back with
the remark “insufficient funds”. Resultantly the petitioner was
constrained to issue a legal notice dated 22nd February, 2006 calling
upon the respondents to pay a sum of Rs.19,95,027.82/- within
seven days of the receipt else the matter would by referred to an
arbitrator for recovery of the aforesaid dues. The notice was received
back by the petitioner with the remark unclaimed. The petitioner
could not send the notice at any other address as the petitioner did
not have any other address of the respondents.

6.

According to the petitioner clause 11.1 of the agreement entered

into between the petitioner and the respondents contained the
Arbitration agreement. Clause 11.1 of the agreement is as under:“11. Arbitration, Jurisdiction and Governing Law
11.1 “All claims, disputes or differences whatsoever which
may at any time hereafter arise between the parties hereto
concerning this Agreement or its construction or effect or as to
the rights, duties obligations or liabilities of the parties hereto
or either of them under or by virtue of or in connection with
this Agreement or any document executed or security created
pursuant hereto or otherwise as to any other matter in any
way connected with or arising out of or in relation to the
subject matter of this Agreement (including without limitation,
enforcement of the security) shall be referred to the
Arbitration of a sole arbitrator jointly appointed by the
parties hereto. The Arbitration shall be conducted in
accordance with and subject to the provisions of Arbitration &
Conciliation Act, 1996 or any statutory modification or

AA No.241/2006

Page 3 of 6

reenactment thereof for the time being in force. The place of
the Arbitration shall be as mentioned in item No.18 of the
Schedule.”

7.

Consequent to the arbitration agreement between the

parties and the fact that disputes had arisen between the
parties, on 16th March, 2006 another notice was issued by the
petitioner to the respondent invoking the arbitration agreement and
seeking consent/concurrence of the respondents to the appointment
of Sh.Sunil Jha, Advocate as an arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes
which have arisen between the parties, which notice was also
returned back with the remark “unclaimed”. The petitioner has
produced the postal receipts in respect of both the notices dated 22nd
February, 2006 and 6th March, 2006 and has contended that despite
an arbitration agreement between the parties the respondents have
failed to give consent for the appointment of Sh.Sunil Jha, Advocate
as sole arbitrator and, therefore, has lost its right to appoint an
arbitrator in terms of arbitration clause and has sought appointment
for an arbitrator by this Court.

8.

Notice of the petition was issued on 20th April, 2006 but since

the respondents were not served by means of ordinary service, on 16 th
March 2007 an order was passed to serve the respondents by

AA No.241/2006

Page 4 of 6

substituted service by way of proclamation in newspaper “Free Press
Journal”(Mumbai Edition) and also by way of affixation on the notice
board of the Court which order was duly complied with by the
petitioner. The citation was published in 29th June 2007 edition of the
newspaper “Free Press Journal” (Mumbai Edition). Despite service of
the notice by proclamation and affixation no one is present on behalf
of respondent, consequently, the respondent is proceeded ex parte.

9.

Despite the service of the notice, no one has appeared on behalf

of respondent nor has any reply been filed. Therefore, it will be just
and appropriate to appoint an sole arbitrator to adjudicate disputes
between the parties.

10.

In totality of circumstances, it is inevitable to infer that there is

arbitration agreement between the parties which is reproduced
hereinabove. In terms of the arbitration agreement the arbitrator was
to be appointed jointly by the parties. The respondent neither gave
consent to the arbitrator appointed by the petitioner nor appointed its
own arbitrator within the stipulated time. No arbitrator was appointed
by the respondent even before the filing of the petition.

11.

A learned Single Judge in Haryana Telecom Ltd. v. Union of

AA No.241/2006

Page 5 of 6

India & Anr., 112 (2004) DLT 339=2004 (3) RAJ 147, had held that if
the respondent fails to appoint an Arbitrator within the stipulated
time of 30 days of the notice, and even after filing of the petition
under Section 11 of the Act, it is for the Court to appoint an
Arbitrator.

12.

Consequently, I appoint Shri S.M. Chopra, Advocate, (Additional

District Judge, Retd.), 181, Deshbandhu Apartment, Kalkaji, New
Delhi-110019 (M: 9213230349, Res.:26484158) as the sole Arbitrator
to adjudicate all the disputes between the petitioner and the
respondents. The fee of the arbitrator shall be Rs.70,000/-. Parties
shall appear before the Arbitrator on 17th December, 2007 at 4:30 PM.
A copy of this order be sent to the Learned Arbitrator forthwith.
Parties are also directed to intimate the Arbitrator about the order.
Copy of this order be given Dasti to the parties.
