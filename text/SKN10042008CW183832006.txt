biswas, in Khasra No.10/11/2(2-13), 20(5-11), 21/2 (3-16) in village

In the year 1999, this land became the subject matter of Notification

under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act and was acquired vide Award
no.4/2002-2003 dated 3rd April, 2002. In view of the said acquisition, the
petitioner claims alternative land. Even though the land in question was
acquired in 1999, the respondent-GNCTD is still examining the claim of the
petitioner. The case of the petitioner is that even if mutation entry was not

made, it is an admitted fact that the petitioner was the owner of the land
and the said land was acquired by the Land and Building Department for
planned development of Delhi. He states that the Sale Deed dated 8th
August, 1988 is admitted and the entire compensation for the said land has
been paid to him. He also relies upon certain other certificates.
As the petitioner’s application has not been decided, the respondent
–Land & Building Department of GNCTD will examine the case of the
petitioner including the documents relied upon by her and after giving
personal hearing to her, application would be disposed of by a speaking
order within

three months from today.

Petitioner will be at liberty to

challenge the speaking order, if required.
Writ Petition is accordingly disposed of. DASTI.
