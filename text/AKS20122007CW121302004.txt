A.K. SIKRI, J.
:
1. All these writ petitions cover the same canvass of facts
and the legal issues raised are also common. In fact, the
judgment of the Central Administrative Tribunal (in short
'CAT'), which is impugned is common by which OAs filed
by different persons were decided.

To have the glimpse

of the issue involved, we may point out at this stage itself
that recruitment for the post of Assistants was done by the
National Council of Education Research and Training (in
short 'NCERT') and the petitioners herein appointed.
Some of the persons, who could not be selected and were
aggrieved, challenged the entire selection process on the
ground that there were large scale irregularities and
bungling in the selection process. Their OAs are allowed
by the impugned judgment dated 22.7.2004 holding that
the selection process is vitiated due to large scale
illegalities and irregularities. This finding is based on the
inquiries conducted by a committee formed by the
Department, which was asked to go into the complaints of
irregularities etc. received by them.

As a consequence,

the selection of the petitioners herein is quashed. We may

2

point out at this stage itself that in so far as official
respondents/Department is concerned, they have accepted
the judgment and do not wish to go ahead with the
appointments/recruitment based on such selection.

We

may also point out that though the petitioners herein are
not seriously contesting the report of the committee,
which went into the allegations and found the bunglings,
their case is that they are not concerned with any such
irregularities allegedly found and even as per the report,
they cannot be treated as beneficiaries of the illegalities.
Therefore, after taking note of the facts in brief as well as
the illegalities found in the selection process, main scope
of this petition is to consider as to whether the petitioners
herein can be treated as a separate class unaffected by
the illegalities and, therefore, be given benefit of their
selection for the purpose of appointment.
2. For the sake of convenience, we will, in the first instance,
take note of the facts appearing in WP(C) No.1213039/2004.

The learned Tribunal has, in the impugned

judgment, given a succinct description of these facts and,
therefore, without any fear of error, we can bank upon
those

facts

in

reproducing
3

the

same

hereinafter.

Respondent Nos.3 and 4 were working as LDCs in the
NCERT at the relevant time, i.e. in the year 2001-02. The
selection process for the post of Assistants was initiated
by

the

NCERT

through

notification

issued

in

the

'Employment News' notifying 40 vacancies in the said
post.

Whereas

21

posts

were

meant

for

general

candidates, 6, 3 and 10 posts were reserved for SC, ST
and

OBC

candidates

respectively.

The

scheme

of

examination consisted of written test, objective type test
and an interview to test the knowledge of computer.

A

total number of 525 candidates appeared in the written
examination.

Results were declared and respondent

Nos.3 and 4 also found their names in the merit list.
Against 40 vacancies, which were available for being filled
up, a list of 56 candidates was prepared, but ultimately
approximately 100 candidates were called for interview.
3. Before

the

Selection

Committee

could

process

the

appointment, on an anonymous complaint received, Prof.
Ved Prakash, Head, DEME was entrusted investigation
into various illegalities committed during the course of
selection process. In this report, scrapping of the entire
examination has been recommended on account of glaring
4

illegalities,

which

rendered

eligible

candidates

into

ineligible and vice-versa, to uphold the majesty and
prestige of the organisation.

The qualifying marks for

general category candidates were 40 and for OBC, SC and
ST were 32. In consultation with Prof. Ved Prakash and
the Controller of Examination, out of 26 recommended
candidates, 18 were recommended for appointment. Rest
of them were deleted. At this stage, respondent Nos.3 and
4 filed OA No.1823/2002 assailing the said selection.
After

examining

the

matter,

the

learned

Tribunal

pronounced its judgment dated 9.12.2002 setting aside
the said selection finding large scale illegalities in the
selection process.

Some of the persons, who were

selected and appointed on the basis of the said selection,
filed WP(C) No.1134/2003 in this Court primarily on the
ground that they were not even made parties in the said
OA filed before the Tribunal.
14.2.2003

was

passed

directing

Interim order dated
that

the

order

of

termination passed on 31.1.2003 on the basis of the
impugned judgment of the Tribunal, be not given effect to.
This writ petition was ultimately decided on 29.7.2003
whereby order of the Tribunal was set aside with liberty to
5

the petitioners in the said petition to be impleaded as
party respondents and the matter was remanded back to
the Tribunal for consideration afresh.

It would be

pertinent to point out at this stage that when the writ
petition was filed against order dated 9.12.2002, though
termination of the petitioners herein was stayed, there
was no stay given in so far as impugned judgment of the
Tribunal is concerned. Since by that judgment selection
was quashed, the NCERT initiated fresh selection process.
In this, respondent Nos.3 and 4 participated but could not
be appointed. Nineteen candidates were selected and two
of them were issued the offer of allotment. However, the
said offer of appointment was subject to final outcome of
the OAs and the writ petitions. This selection process was
also challenged by filing OA No.1442/2004 on the same
ground,

namely,

that

the

process

was

vitiated

by

illegalities.
4. The two OAs, namely, OA Nos.1823/2002 and 1442/2004
dealing with two selection processes for the filling up of
the post of Assistants were taken up together by the
Tribunal. The Tribunal directed production of the relevant
records.

The NCERT furnished a preliminary report,
6

which was on the basis of inquiry conducted during the
pendency of the OAs in both the selection processes. The
preliminary report showed large scale illegalities in both
the selection process, and included, increase of marks of
some of the candidates; rounding off of marks in the
descriptive paper and in the objective paper; signatures of
checkers and evaluator were missing and there were
interpolation in the selection process held during the
course of pendency of CWP; signatures of superintendent
of the Examination Centre were conspicuously missing;
and there were over-writing in the marks allotted. There
is no serious challenge to the said illegalities which crept
in the selection process.
5. The only question, which was argued before the Tribunal,
was: "Whether, as a result of these illegalities, entire
selection process was required to be struck down or it was
possible to weed out the beneficiaries of the illegalities
and, therefore, the quashing was to be limited to those
beneficiaries only?"

Whereas respondent Nos.3 and 4

(applicants in the OA), contended that it was difficult to
weed

out

the

beneficiaries

of

the

illegalities

and,

therefore, entire selection process stood vitiated, the
7

argument of the other side was that the petitioners herein
were not the beneficiaries of such illegalities at all, even
as per the report and, therefore, their selection could have
been maintained and should not be interfered with.

In

order to consider this aspect, the learned Tribunal went
through the report of investigation before it. As per the
report, following discrepancies were found in the first
selection process, as is evident from the data:-

-That the examination was written by as many as 510
candidates.
-That of 510 candidates, as many as 104 candidates were
found eligible to be called for interview.

The eligibility

was determined on the basis of minimum qualifying marks
for each paper, which for the Descriptive paper happened
to be as under:
Table-1

be awarded minimum qualifying marks. It is quite alarming
that 58% of the cases in general and 13% in OBC category
got bunched at the minimum qualifying score of 40-a
phenomenon

which

is

highly

improbable

in

such

a

situation.
-That there are quite a few candidates who have secured
more than 40 marks in the Descriptive paper.

Some of

them have got as high a score as 50, 48, 47, 46 etc. When
marks of such candidates are seen in relation to their
marks in the paper of Rules & Regulations, it is observed
that their corresponding marks are much lower in that
paper as against those candidates who h ave just been
awarded the qualifying score of 40 after alteration in the
Descriptive paper.

Strangely candidates with qualifying

score of 40 in Descriptive paper have secured as high a
score as 97, 90, 89 etc. in the rules and regulations paper
as is evident from Table 3.1.

-That the data posted in table-3.1 strangely reveal that
candidates getting highest & higher scores in rules &
regulations papers have secured merely a qualifying score
of 40 and that too after alteration.
-That the data clearly indicate that the examiner firstly
seems to have arbitrarily identified those cases where the
candidates

have

secured

high

scores

in

Rules

&

Regulation Paper but did not qualify in Descriptive paper
11

and subsequently altered their scores so as to enable them
to qualify for the interview.
-That furthermore, low degree of correlation between the
scores of two papers shown in Table 3.1 and Table 3.2
confirms the aforesaid suspicion on the one hand and it
also creates apprehension even beyond the boundaries of
Descriptive paper on the other hand.
-That the aforesaid analysis of the data indicates glaring
irregularities which would not withstand any test of
scrutiny.
-That in such a situation when interviews have already
been conducted, re-evaluation of the answer scrips of the
Descriptive paper might render some of the eligible
candidates into non-eligible zone and vice versa and thus
will

further

mess

up

the

entire

issue

and

thus

compromise the credibility of the organisation.
-That in view of the above, it is suggested that the entire
examination may be scrapped and it may be rescheduled
afresh because nothing is dearer than the prestige of the
organisation.
6. The aforesaid report leads to the following analysis, as
indicated in the report itself:12

(a) out of 510 candidates, 104 were found
eligible to be called for interview. In 26 cases
the marks of descriptive paper were found
altered and 21 out of these 26 candidates were
pushed to scale the qualifying marks. In many
cases, the

marks awarded were minimum

qualifying marks.

These constituted 58% of

candidates in general category and 13% in OBC
category.

Thus, 32 out of 55 in general

category and 3 out of 23 in OBC category got
minimum qualifying score, which, according to
the

committee,

was

a

highly

improbable

phenomena in such a situation. The indication
was that their score must have been pushed to
achieve the minimum qualifying score to enable
them to be called for the interview.
(b)

many of these, who had been awarded just

the qualifying score of 40 after alteration in the
descriptive paper, scored as high score as 97,
90, 89 etc. in the rules and regulation paper.
(c)

as per the committee, it appeared that the

examiner

first
13

arbitrarily

identified

those

candidates, who had scored high marks in rules
and regulation paper but had not qualified any
descriptive paper and to make them eligible
subsequently

altered

their

score

in

the

descriptive paper.
7. In such a situation when interviews had already been
conducted, the committee opined that the re-evaluation of
the answer scripts of the descriptive paper might render
some of the eligible candidates into non-eligible zone and
vice versa, which would further mess up the entire issue
and thus, compromise the credibility of the organisation.
Therefore, the committee suggested that the entire
examination be scrapped to save the prestige of the
organisation.
8. The Tribunal had also gone through in detail the said
report and it has recorded its observations in the following
words:“On perusal of the sheet, we find that
there has been consistent rounding
off
marks,
conspicuous
missing
signatures of evaluator and checker.
The preliminary report during the
pendency of this OA in respect of
respondents clearly shows that there
were illegalities in the process
whereby rounding off marks and
14

signatures of the checker and
evaluator were missing. In one of the
cases
the
marks
have
been
interpolated with someone making
the candidate eligible. Not only the
private
respondents
but
the
applicants' marks were also rounded
off. Accordingly, on close scrutiny,
the following illegalities have been
found on a preliminary investigation
carried out during pendency of the
OAs:
“Upon close scrutiny of the answer
sheets of the candidates named
hereinabove,
the
following
irregularities have been noticed:

1. Increasing of

2. Rounding of 1/2 marks.
3. Marks of Karunesh Sodhi who got
33 marks inter-changed with the
marks of Sanjay Rohilla who got 41.

1. Signature of the checker missing in
all the objective paper answer
sheets.
2. Signature of the evaluator missing

3. Marks written in pencil and some

15

9. The illegalities, which were pointed out in the preliminary
investigation report, regarding the second examination
are the following:“The bundle containing the answer
sheets of 162 candidates handed over
by Prof. V.K. Jain, Controller of
Examinations, in sealed cover was
opened and random checking of the
same was conducted in the office of
the LA, NCERT, and it was found that:
I: The GK Paper I (nos. 162) did not
bear any marking 3 of the answer
sheets (viz., of Roll nos. 5497 coded
242760, Roll no.6328 coded 243068
of Shri Uma Kant & Roll No. 6568
coded 243164) did not bear the
signatures of the Superintendent of
the Examination Centre.
II: The written Expression Paper II
bore the markings, although in one
bearing coded No.240054 there were
overwritings on the marks allotted.
There are overwriting in the marking
with regard to Roll No. 6328 coded
243068 of Shri Uma Kant. In the case
of Shri Ravinder Kumar coded
242272, the marks in one place had
been reduced by overwriting.
III: The Rules & Regulation Paper III
were examined at random and the
answer sheet of the same coded
No.240054 again bore overwriting on
the marks. There are overwriting in
the marking with regard to Roll No.
6328 coded 243068 of Shri Uma Kant.
The

undersigned
16

specifically

10.

examined the answer-sheets of those
GC candidates against whom there
were
specific
complaints
of
manipulations,
and
at
random
checking the findings noted were
found.”
The Tribunal, in these circumstances, concluded that

it was not possible to weed out the beneficiaries of the
illegalities and the entire selection process had to be given
a go-by.

It, thus, negatived the contentions of the

petitioners herein that the interpolations, which were
carried out, had no effect on the petitioners and their
appointments were cleared by the committee.

The

Tribunal recorded that a short-listing process had been
arrived at whereby out of several candidates, 25 SC and
23 OBC candidates had found way to the interview. Had
there been any rounding of marks, the others, who were
coming within the zone of eligibility, would have marched
over the private respondents and would have been
interviewed.

This has deprived them an opportunity of

equal participation in the selection. This is also the case
with SC and ST candidates.

As regard to one of the

general candidates who has been interpolated with
someone the same is also an illegality showing that
process was not transparent and mass enblock illegalities
17

had taken place in both the selection which reflects on the
integrity and functioning of the respondent organisation.
11.

On this basis, the Tribunal observed as under:-

12.

“37. The preliminary report both of Prof.
Ved Prakash and Capt. K.K. Joshi, VSO,
NCERT, is an admission to the effect that
both the selection processes had engrossed
with material illegalities. We cannot by
this standard weed out the beneficiaries of
illegalities.
The scope and zone of
consideration was increased and ineligible
persons have been inducted have found
place in the list of appointed candidates.
On presumption, we cannot draw any
conclusion but the fact that both the
selection processes incorporate an unfair
selection process and glaring illegalities,
we cannot expect such an action as fair.
Rule of law shall have to prevail.”
The Tribunal also, while quashing the selection,

expected that corrective measures would be taken by the
official respondents. The Ministry of Human Resource
Development was requested to fix the responsibility of the
erring officials for appropriate action. We may point out
at this stage that after the aforesaid observations the
matter was got examined and final report submitted by
the committee was placed before us at the time of
hearing. In order to consider the question at hand, we
shall refer the findings of this report at the appropriate
stage.
18

13.

As has been pointed out by us in the beginning that

the bungling and irregularities, which are found by the
Committee in its report, in the aforesaid selection process,
are not disputed by the petitioners.

The petitioners,

however, say that they are not the beneficiaries of those
malpractices and in so far as they are concerned, their
appointment can be saved as it is not tainted in any
manner. Therefore, the entire thrust of our discussion is
to

focus

on

the

issue

as

to

whether

the

alleged

interpolations and irregularities had the effect on the
appointments of the petitioners as well, and the answer to
this would depend on the issue as to whether it would be
possible to weed out the beneficiaries of the illegalities by
separating the grain from the chaff.
14.

Learned counsel for the petitioner had argued that

the interpolations mentioned by Prof. Ved Prakash in his
report had no effect on their appointments and for this
reason, even in the said report the petitioners were
cleared. It was also stressed that same was the position
even in the second report and thus, both the reports had
not pointed any finger on any of the petitioners. It was
also

submitted

that

the
19

learned

Tribunal

failed

to

appreciate that the names of the petitioners figure in
Table 3.2 at serial Nos.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 9, which would
show that they had scored good remarks in both the
papers, i.e. descriptive paper and rules and regulation
paper and there was no occasion for any of them to be
given grace marks, nor any rounding off of the marks was
needed for them to qualify the test.

It was upon due

scrutinisation of the papers that Prof. Ved Prakash as well
as Prof. R.S. Saxena and Prof. G.L. Arora had carried out
the weeding of persons who had benefitted due to grant of
grace marks illegally and in the process of declaring eight
eligible candidates ineligible. In the second report of Mr.
K.K. Joshi, again it was brought out that in case of the
petitioners, there was no such illegality detected, which
leads to their selection being declared illegal.

It was,

thus, submitted that the Tribunal should not have quashed
the entire selection process.

Learned counsel for the

petitioners relied upon the judgments of the Supreme
Court in the following cases in support:-

1. Union
of
India
Vs.
Rajesh
P.U.
Puthuvalnikathu & another, 2003 (7) SCC
285.

20

2. Umesh Chandra Shukla Vs. Union of India
and Ors., AIR 1985 SC 351.

15.

3. Harshendia Choubisa and Anr. Vs. State of
Rajasthan and Ors., (2002) 6 SCC 393.
In Union of India Vs. Rajesh P.U. (supra), the Apex

Court held that in cases where it is possible to weed out
the beneficiaries of illegalities, the selection process to
that extent only be set aside leaving out the persons who
had no concern with such malpractices.

Following

observations of the Supreme Court need a quote:“On a careful consideration of the
contentions on either side in the light of the
relevant portions of the report said to have
been submitted by the Special Committee
constituted for the purpose of inquiring into
the irregularities, if any, in the selection of
candidates, filed on our directions- which
report itself seems to have been also
produced for the perusal of the High Court –
there appears to be no scope for any
legitimate grievance against the decision
rendered by the High Court. There seems to
be no serious grievance of any malpractices
as such in the process of candidates or by
those who actually conducted them. If the
Board itself decide to dictate the questions
on a loudspeaker in English and Hindi and
none of the participants had any grievance
in understanding them or answering them,
there is no justification to surmise at a later
stage that the time lapse in dictating them
in different languages left any room or
scope for the candidates to discuss among
them the possible answers. The posting of
invigilators for every ten candidates would
belie any such assumption. Even that apart,
21

the Special Committee constituted does not
appear to have condemned that part of the
selection process relating to conduct of the
written examination itself, except noticing
only certain infirmities only in the matter of
evaluation of answer-sheets with reference
to correct answers and allotment of marks to
answers thereto, it appears that the Special
Committee has extensively scrutinized and
reviewed the situation by re-evaluating the
answer-sheets of all the 134 successful
candidates and found to have been declared
successful though they were not really
entitled to be so declared successful and
selected for whatsoever in the selection of
the other successful candidates than the 31
identified by the Special Committee. In the
light of the above and in the absence of any
specific or categorical finding supported by
any concrete and relevant material that
widespread infirmities of an all-pervasive
nature, which could be really said to have
undermined the very process itself in its
entirety or as a whole and it as impossible to
weed out the beneficiaries of one or the
other irregularities, or illegalities, if any,
there was hardly any justification in law to
deny appointment to the other selected
candidates whose selections were not found
to be, in any manner, vitiated for any one or
the other reasons. Applying a unilaterally
rigid and arbitrary standard to cancel the
entirety of the selections despite the firm
and positive information that except 31 of
such selected candidates, no infirmity could
be found with reference to others, is nothing
but total disregard of relevancies and
allowing to be carried away by irrelevancies,
giving a complete go-by to contextual
considerations throwing to the winds the
principle of proportionality in going farther
than what was strictly and reasonably to
meet the situation. In short, the competent
22

16.

authority completely misdirected itself in
taking such an extreme and unreasonable
decision of cancelling the entire selections,
wholly unwarranted and unnecessary even
on the factual situation
found too, and
totally in excess of the nature and gravity of
what was at stake, threreby virtually
rendering such decision to be irrational.”
In Umesh Chandra Shukla Vs. Union of India (supra)

selection to Delhi Judicial Service was in challenge.

As

per the Rules, every candidate was required to obtain a
minimum of 50% marks in each paper and overall 60%
marks to qualify for interview.

The High Court, which

conducted the examination, granted 2 marks to every
candidate

in

every

paper

thereby

candidates qualified for interview.

rendering

many

The Supreme Court

held that grant of grace marks was illegal. Therefore, the
selections of the candidates who were given grace marks
was held to be bad in law.

However, those candidates

who were selected without any grace marks and in whose
case no illegalities were found were declared successful.
Likewise, in the case of Harshendia Choubisa Vs. State of

Rajasthan (supra), the Supreme Court held, where the
awarding of grace marks by the Government of Rajasthan
on the basis of locality was found to be irrational,
unreasonable and illegal.
23

However, the Supreme Court

directed that selection already made on the basis of
erroneous interpretation cannot be disturbed and the
subsequent interpretation will be given prospective effect.
Moreover, even from the list of selected candidates who
could not join were allowed to do the same and the relief
to the appellant was limited only to their case only in the
situation of their having better marks than the selected
candidates.
17.

As per the Preliminary Report, Paras Ram has only

39.5 marks which was rounded to 40, whereas in the case
of private respondents they have scored well above the
bench

mark

as

applicable

in

their

case

(except

Respondent No.8, whose case there was human error
during coding and decoding of roll numbers).
18.

Before discussing the case at hand, we may also take

note of some more judgments of the Apex Court, which
are referred to by the Tribunal as well. In Union of India

& Ors. Vs. O. Chakradhar, (2002) 3 SCC 146, the Court
opined that where the illegality and irregularity are so
inter-mixed with the whole process of selection that it
becomes impossible to sort out the right from the wrong
or vice versa, then the whole selection process is to be
24

quashed.

The Court had affirmed the decision of the

authorities to cancel the selection and made the following
observations in the process:-

“12. As per the report of the CBI, the whole
selection smacks of mala fides and
arbitrariness. All norms are said to have
been violated with impunity at each stage
viz., right from the stage of entertaining
applications, with answer-sheets while in the
custody of Chairman, in holding typing test,
in interview and in the end while preparing
the final result. In such circumstances it
may not be possible to pick out or choose a
few persons in respect of whom alone the
selection could be cancelled and their
services in pursuance thereof could be
terminated. The illegality and irregularity
are so intermixed with the whole process of
the selection that it becomes impossible to
sort out the right from the wrong or vice
versa. The result of such a misconduct on
the part of a candidate is to be gone into but
a case where those who conducted the
selection
have
rendered
it
wholly
unacceptable. Guilt of those who have been
selected is not the question under
consideration but the question is, could such
selection be acted upon in the matter of
public employment? We are therefore of the
view that it is not one of those cases where it
may have been possible to issue any
individual notice of misconduct to each
selected and seek his explanation in regard
to the large-scale, widespread and allpervasive illegalities and irregularities
committed by those who conducted the
selection which may of course possibly be for
the benefit of those who have been selected
but there may be a few who may have
deserved selection otherwise, but it is
25

19.

difficult to separate the cases of some of the
candidates from the rest even if they may be
some. The decision in that case of Christen
Yadav applies to the facts of the present
case. The Railway Board's decision to cancel
the selection cannot be faulted with. The
appeal therefore deserves to be allowed.”
Same course of action was adopted by the Supreme

Court in Union of India and Ors. Vs. Tarun K. Singh and
Ors., 2002 (3) ATJ 185, holding that process of selection
stood vitiated by adoption of large scale malpractices to a
public office. Relevant observations of the Court in this
judgment are as under:“4.
The question for consideration is
whether the learned single Judge of
Allahabad High Court was justified in
interfering with an order of cancellation
passed by the competent authority and direct
that the process of selection should be
completed.
Needless to mention that
subsequent to the order of cancellation, in
view of the allegation of malpractice, the
departmental authorities have held an
enquiry into the matter and the result of that
enquiry has revealed gross irregularities and
illegalities as referred to in the judgment of
the Division Bench of Allahabad High Court.
Consequently the process of selection which
stands vitiated by adoption of large scale
malpractice to a public office, cannot be
permitted to be sustained by Court of Law.
That apart, an individual applicant for any
particular post does not get a right to be
enforced by a Mandamus unless and until he
is selected in the process of selection and
gets the letter of appointment. In the case in
hand, much before the so-called list of
26

selection was approved by the Railway
Board, the order of cancellation had
emanated on the basis of the complaint
received from so many quarters. In view of
the subsequent findings of the enquiry
committee which has gone into the matter,
we have no hesitation in coming to the
conclusion that the learned single Judge of
Allahabad High Court was wholly in error in
issuing the direction in question and,
therefore, the Division Bench of Allahabad
High Court was fully justified in interfering
with the said order of learned single Judge of
Allahabad High Court. The Division Bench of
Calcutta High Court committed error in
following the judgment of learned single
Judge of Allahabad High Court.
The
judgment of Division Bench of Calcutta High
Court is set aside and the judgment of
Division Bench of Allahabad High Court is
upheld. In the circumstances, we allow the
union's appeals and dismiss the appeals filed
on behalf of the individual candidates. The
appeals are disposed of accordingly. Any
other question of law remains open.”
20.

The Apex Court had the occasion to consider such an

issue once again in a recent judgment entitled Inderpreet

Singh Kahlon Vs. State of Punjab and Ors., (2006) 11 SCC
356. In that case one Ravinderpal Singh Sidhu was the
Chairman of the Punjab Public Service Commission
between 1996 to 2002.

Allegations were made against

him that he got a large number of persons appointed on
extraneous

considerations

including

monetary

consideration. Such appointments were said to have been
27

made during the period 1998 to 2001. On consideration
of

the

entire

material

placed

before

it,

the

State

Government decided to cancel the entire selection made
for recruitment to PCS (Executive Branch) and Allied
Services in 1998. Regarding judicial officers appointed to
PCS (Judicial Branch), the High Court constituted two
Scrutiny Committees, which were accepted by the High
Court. On the recommendations made by the High Court,
the State Government terminated the service of those who
were appointed on the basis of the selection made by the
Commission against the vacancies of the years 1998, 1999
and 2000. The persons whose services were terminated
approached the High Court by filing number of writ
petitions, which were, however, dismissed by the Full
Bench of the High Court.

In these circumstances, they

approached the Supreme Court.
21.

The Bench consisting of Hon'ble Mr. Justice S.B.

Sinha and Hon'ble Mr. Justice Dalveer Bhandari gave
separate judgments, though with same conclusion. It was
held that if an appointment is made in violation of Articles
14 and 16 of the Constitution of India, same would be void
and nullity.

In view of the law laid down by the
28

Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of

Secretary, State of Karnataka Vs. Umadevi, (2006) 4 SCC
1, the Court further held that when the services were not
terminated in terms of Rules, but on the ground that
various irregularities were committed in the selection
process

involved,

the

applicability

of

the

relevant

provisions of the statutes and the effect of provisions of
Article 311 of the Constitution was not required to be
considered.

However,

before

terminating

the

appointments on this ground, the appointing authority
must take into consideration the foundational facts. Only
when such foundational facts are established, the legal
principles can be applied. The authority taking decision to
cancel the process or terminate the appointment, if
already appointed, had to establish that the process was
tainted; that the entire selection process was liable to be
cancelled and the question, which requires consideration
in such matters, is as to whether due to misdeeds of some
candidates, honest and meritorious candidates should also
suffer. The Court opined that a distinction exists between
a proven case of mass cheating for a board examination
and an unproven imputed charge of corruption where the
29

appointment of a civil servant is involved.

Only in the

event it is found to be impossible or highly improbable
that the tainted case can be separated from the nontainted cases could en masse orders of termination be
issued. Both the State Government as also the High Court
in that view of the matter should have made all
endeavours to segregate the tainted from the non-tainted
candidates.
22.

The Supreme Court also delineated the cases where

selection process could be perceived to be tainted by
categorising them as under:(i) Cases where the “event” has been investigated.
(ii) Cases where CBI inquiry took place and was
completed

or

a

preliminary

investigation

was

concluded.
(iii) Cases where the selection was made but
appointment was not made.
(iv) Cases where the candidates were also ineligible
and the appointments were found to be contrary to
law or rules.
23.
cases

The Court drew the distinction between those
where

irregularities
30

were

found

in

the

selection process before the appointments could be
made and those where appointments had already
been made. It is one thing to say that having regard
to the nature of selection process, no person is
appointed from the select list as no person has a
right to be appointed only because his name appears
in the select list, but a different standard must be
adopted for terminating the services of the officers
who had completed about three years of service. In
those cases where the

appointees had put in a few

years of service, the Court opined that before
terminating their services,

compliance with three

principles at the hands of the State was imperative
viz.:
(1)

to

establish

satisfaction

in

regard

to

the

sufficiency of the materials collected so as to enable
the State to arrive at its satisfaction that the
selection process was tainted;
(2) to determine the question that the illegalities
committed went to the root of the matter, which
vitiate the entire selection process. Such satisfaction
as also the sufficiency of materials were required to
31

be gathered by reason of a thorough investigation in
a fair and transparent manner;
(3) whether the sufficient material present enabled
the State to arrive at a satisfaction that the officers
in majority had been found to be part of the
fraudulent purpose or the system itself was corrupt.

24.

It would be useful to refer to the following portion

of the judgment wherein the Court had taken note of
earlier judgment and discussed the ratio of those cases:In Bihar School Examination
Board v. Subhash Chandra Sinha and
Ors., (1970) 1 SCC 648 the court came to
“47.

a finding that the high percentage of
marks obtained by the candidates who
appeared at the selection of the centre in
question did give rise to a suspicion that
unfair means had been practised and the
Board was justified in investigating the
case. While the High Court held that
despite the same, the principles of natural
justice was required to be complied with,
this Court noticed the reports of the
experts and came to the conclusion that
the results thereof speaks for themselves.
It was noticed Page 2452 that whereas in
other centers the average of successful
candidates was 50%, in the center in
question, the percentage of passing in
different papers were unusually high
ranging from 70% to 100%. In that view
of the matter, this Court held: (SCC p.
652, paras 12-13)
32

“12. These figures speak for themselves.
However, to satisfy ourselves we ordered
that some answer books be brought for
our inspection and many such were
produced. A comparison of the answer
books
showed
such
a
remarkable
agreement in the answers that no doubt
was left in our minds that the students
had assistance from an outside source.
Therefore the conclusion that unfair
means were adopted stands completely
vindicated.
13. This is not a case of any particular
individual who is being charged with
adoption of unfair means but of the
conduct of all the examinees or at least a
vast majority of them at a particular
centre. If it is not a question of charging
any one individually with unfair means
but to condemn the examination as
ineffective for the purpose it was held.
Must the Board give an opportunity to all
the candidates to represent their cases?
We think not. It was not necessary for the
Board to give an opportunity to the
candidates if the examinations as a whole
were being cancelled. The Board had not
charged any one with unfair means so
that he could claim to defend himself. The
examination was vitiated by adoption of
unfair means on a mass scale. In these
circumstances it would be wrong to insist
that the Board must hold a detailed
inquiry into the matter and examine each
individual case to satisfy itself which of
the candidates had not adopted unfair
means. The examination as a whole had to
go.”

33

Such is not the case here.
48. In Anamica Mishra and Ors. v. U.P.
Public Service Commission, 1990 (Supp)
SCC 692, an error was found out at the
stage of calling candidates for interview.
This Court opined that as no defect was
pointed out in regard to the written
examination and the sole objection was
confined to the exclusion of a group of
successful candidates in interview there
was no justification for cancelling the
written
part
of
the
recruitment
examination and the situation could have
been appropriately met by setting aside
the recruitment and asking for fresh
interview of all eligible candidates on the
basis of the written examination.
49. Yet again in S.P. Biswas and Ors. v.
State Bank of India, 1991 Supp (2) SCC
354, the court refused to interfere with
the result of the examination as it was
shown that there had been neither any
mass copying nor the final result was
shown to have been influenced by the
unfair means by any candidate.
50. In those cases also tainted cases were
separated from the non-tainted cases.
Only, thus, in the event it is found to be
an impossible or highly improbable, en
masse orders of termination could have
been issued.
51. Both the State Government as also
the High Court in that view of the matter
should have made all endeavours to
segregate the tainted from the nontainted candidates.
34

52. We may, at this stage, notice that the
following cases would fall in the different
categories
which
are
enumerated
hereinbelow:
(i) Cases where the “event” has been
investigated:
(a) Union Territory of Chandigarh v.
Dilbagh Singh,(1993) 1 SCC 154, SCC at
paras 3 and 7.
(b) Krishan Yadav v. State of Haryana,
(1994) 4 SCC 165, SCC at paras 12, 15
and 22.

Union of India v. Anand Kumar
Pandey, (1994) 5 SCC 663, SCC at para

(d) Hanuman Prasad v. Union of India,
(1996) 10 SCC 742, SCC at para 4.
(e) Union of India v. O. Chakradhar,
(2002) 3 SCC 146, SCC at para 9.
(f) B. Ramanjini v. State of A.P., (2002) 5
SCC 533, SCC at para 4
(ii) Cases where CBI inquiry took place
and was completed or a preliminary
investigation was concluded:
(a) O. Chakradhar (supra)
(b) Krishan Yadav (supra)
(c) Hanuman Prasad (supra)
(iii) Cases where the selection was made
but appointment was not made:
35

(a) Dilbagh Singh (supra) at para 3
(b) Pritpal Singh v. State of Haryana,
(1994) 5 SCC 695
(c) Anand Kumar Pandey (supra) at para
4.
(d) Hanuman Prasad (supra)
(e) B. Ramanjini (supra) at para 4.
(iv) Cases where the candidates were also
ineligible and the appointments were
found to be contrary to law or rules:
(a) Krishan Yadav (supra)
(b) Pramod Lahudas Meshram v. State of
Maharashtra, (1996) 10 SCC 749, wherein
appointments had been made without
following the selection procedure.
(c) O. Chakradhar (supra) wherein
appointments had been made without
typewriting tests and other procedures of
selection having not been followed.
53. It is now well-settled that a decision is
an authority for what it decides and not
what can logically be deduced therefrom.
It is also well settled that a ratio of case
must be understood having regard to the
fact situation obtaining therein. [See P.S.

Sathappan (Dead) By LRs. v. Andhra Bank
Ltd. and Ors., (2004) 11 SCC 672, M.P.
Gopalakrishnan Nair v. State of Kerala,
(2005) 11 SCC 45 and Haryana State
Coop. Land Development Bank v. Neelam,
(2005) 5 SCC 91.)”
25.

Keeping in view the aforesaid legal propositions in

mind, we have to examine as to whether the entire
36

selection process stood vitiated in the present case as
held by the learned Tribunal or it can be discerned that
the cases of the petitioners herein can be segregated and
there are also not the beneficiaries of the alleged
malpractices.
26.

We have already indicated the analysis done by Prof.

Ved Prakash, of the examination results and relevant
portion thereof is reproduced above. 510 candidates had
appeared in the examination.

As per the report, in 26

cases, marks of the descriptive paper were found altered.
As a result of this, 21 candidates were pushed to the scale
of qualifying score and were called for the interview.
Thus, these 21 candidates, but for the alteration in the
marks in the descriptive paper, would not have qualified
for the interview. However, it could not be disputed that
the petitioners, who belong to the SC, ST and OBC
category are not among those whose marks were altered.
27.

The Committee also found that few candidates, who

had secured more than 40 marks in the descriptive paper,
their corresponding marks in other paper, i.e. paper of
rules and regulation are much lower. On the other hand,
those who were given qualifying score of 40 marks in the
37

descriptive paper, which made them eligible to appear in
the interview, had got very high score in the rules and
regulation paper.

But for giving them the qualifying

marks of 40 by rounding off, they would not have even
qualified to be called for interview.

However, after

making them eligible for interview, they marched over
those who had high marks in descriptive paper but low
marks

in

rules

and

regulation

paper.

This

is

demonstrated in Table 301 and Table 3.2 of the report.
From this, the Committee observed that the examiner
firstly seems to have arbitrarily identified those cases
where the candidates had secured high scores in rules
and regulation paper but did not qualify in descriptive
paper and subsequently altered their score as to enable
them to qualify for the interview.

The Committee also

opined that since interviews had already been conducted,
re-evaluation of answer scripts of the descriptive paper
might render some of the eligible candidates into noneligible zone and vice versa which will further mess up
the entire issue.

Learned counsel for the petitioners,

however, pointed out that those cases demonstrated in
Table 3.1 where marks in descriptive paper were rounded
38

off to 40 to make them eligible did not include any of the
petitioners.

On the other hand, example of those cases

given in Table 302 where marks obtained by the
candidates were more in descriptive paper but less in
rules and regulation paper included one of the petitioners
at serial No.2.

Therefore, argued the learned counsel,

instead of being the beneficiary, the petitioners, if at all,
were the victims and could still qualify. Learned counsel
for the petitioners also submitted that specific illegalities
which were pointed out in the descriptive and objective
paper did not include the cases of the petitioners.
28.

In fact, counsel for the respondents, including

counsel for the private respondents could not dispute that
the petitioners were not the beneficiaries in the sense that
their marks in the descriptive paper were not interpolated
to make it 40 thereby making them eligible to appear in
the

interview

and

consequential

selection.

Notwithstanding the same, the reason given by the
Tribunal, which was highlighted by the learned counsel
for the NCERT as well as the private respondents, was
that as a result of shortlisting process, 25 SC candidates
and 23 OBC candidates had found their way to the
39

interview. Had there been no rounding off marks, others,
who were coming within the zone of eligibility, would
have marched over these petitioners and would have been
interviewed.

This

had

deprived

such

persons

an

opportunity of equal participation in the selection and
because of this, the entire process of selection was
vitiated

as

it

was

not

possible

to

weed

out

the

beneficiaries of illegalities. According to the Tribunal, the
scope and zone of consideration were increased and
ineligible persons had been inducted and found place in
the list of appointed candidates.
29.

We have have not been able to appreciate the

aforesaid causal connection. Total number of candidates
who were called for the interview were: 55 in general
category, 23 in OBC, 25 in SC and 1 in ST category.
Number of candidates with altered marks were 21. Since
we are concerned with OBC, SC and ST candidates to
which category the petitioners belong, as per Table 3
attached to the report of Prof. Ved Prakash Committee, 4
candidates out of 23 OBC candidates and 2 candidates out
of 25 SC candidates were the beneficiaries of the
alteration who had been pushed to the qualifying marks.
40

As far as the petitioners are concerned, without any such
alterations they had scored more than 40 marks and
would have been called for the interviews in any case.
With the inclusion of 4 persons in OBC category and 2 in
SC category, who became the beneficiary of the illegality,
6 other persons belonging to these categories are
deprived of their right to be considered after calling them
for interview as instead of these 6 persons whose marks
are altered, some other persons would have been called
for the interview. However, by no means it can be said
that the petitioners would not have been called for the
interview. The deduction on the part of the Tribunal that
some other persons who were coming within the zone of
eligibility would have marched over the petitioners herein
and would have been interview are clearly untenable.

30.

No doubt, there have been discrepancies in the

selection process, as found by Prof. Vaid Prakash
Committee on the basis of which he recommended
cancellation of the results.

However, the foregoing

discussion would make it clear that the discrepancies
were found in other cases and not in the case of the
petitioners and it was also possible to separate the cases
41

of the petitioners from those who were the beneficiaries
of the irregularities. Prof. Vaid Prakash obviously did not
examine the matter from this angle while suggesting
cancellation. In view of the principles laid down by the
Supreme Court in the judgments noted above, in
particular the case of

Inderpreet Singh Kahlon (supra)

wherein the Supreme Court re-stated the legal principles
after scanning through the entire case law, the situation
where the cases of those who were the bona fide and
innocent persons can be saggregated, the selection in
respect of those persons is not to be cancelled.
31.

Insofar as the two Member Committee is

concerned, it was constituted on the direction of the
Tribunal with the objective of fixing the responsibility on
those who were instrumental in the said illegalities. This
Committee has examined the entire matter keeping in
view the aforesaid term of reference and gave the names
of the persons who were responsible for the mess.
32.

There is one more aspect which needs to be

highlighted at this stage.

These petitioners, who are

admittedly not the beneficiaries of the illegalities, got the
appointment in July 2002. Many of these petitioners left
42

their earlier jobs after their selection in the NCERT as
Assistants.

They have worked on these posts for more

than five years now. Terminating their appointments at
this stage when they are not the part of blemished
selection process nor the beneficiaries thereof, would be
highly unjust and improper.

Things would have been

different had they been parties to the irregularities and
illegalities committed in the selection process or the
beneficiaries thereof. The Court would have taken serious
view in such circumstances and would not have been
guided by equitable considerations.

However, after

finding that in so far as these petitioners are concerned,
they are innocent; they have been selected on their own
merit, uninfluenced by some of the illegalities committed
to help certain other persons; they have given up their
earlier jobs to join the NCERT and are working now for
more than 5½ years, we are of the opinion that their case
can

be segregated as stand alone and untouched,

uninfluenced by the irregularities in the selection process.
Therefore, in so far as the cases of the petitioners herein
are concerned, we are of the view that their selection
should not be interfered with and while upholding the
43

remaining selection process as vitiated, we direct that the
cases of the petitioners shall not be affected thereby and
they will continue to hold the post of Assistants on which
they are selected on their own merits. These petitions are
allowed to the aforesaid extent. There shall be no orders
as to costs.
