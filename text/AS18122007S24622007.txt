ARUNA SURESH, J. (Oral)
1. Plaintiff is the Chief Operating Officer of Kuoni Travel India
Pvt. Ltd. He was earlier in the SITA World Travel. SITA
World Travel was amalgamated with Kuoni Travel India
Pvt. Ltd. by judicial order dated 16.8.2000 passed by the
High

Court

of

CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Judicature

at

Bombay.

After

the

Page 1 of 15

amalgamation SITA World Travel ceased to exist.

2. Plaintiff claims himself to be a member of the defendant
No. 1. The day to day business of defendant No. 1 Indian
Association of Tour Operators is looked after by a
Executive

Committee

as

per

the

Memorandum

Association (hereinafter referred to as 'MOA').

of

Though

SITA's membership was never formally transferred to
Kuoni but yearly subscription fee was being paid by Kuoni
and accepted by defendant No. 1.

The Executive

Committee of defendant No. 1 declared elections of the
Executive Committee through circular dated 23.10.2007
and the outgoing committee appointed defendant No. 1 Mr.
S.K. Gupta as the Returning Officer to complete the
process of election. The Executive Committee of defendant
No. 1 scrutinized the nomination forms of all the aspirants
in its meeting held on 22.11.2007 and notified the plaintiff
as valid candidate seeking election to the post of Senior
Vice President in the IATO election and a final list of
nominations was announced in which name of the plaintiff
was included for the post of Senior Vice President.
However, there was re-scrutiny of the nomination of the
plaintiff by defendant No. 2 who rejected the nomination of
the plaintiff and disqualified him from contesting the

CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 2 of 15

elections.

This act of the Returning Officer has been

challenged by the plaintiff and by way this application he
has sought interim relief for restraining the defendant from
acting in furtherance of the letter dated 6.12.2007 and
allow the plaintiff to contest the election for the post of
Senior Vice President in terms of letter dated 22.11.2007
or postpone the election scheduled for 22.12.2007 during
the pendency of the suit.

3. Notice of this application was duly served upon the
defendants who has put in appearance.

4. I have heard learned counsel for the parties and have
carefully perused the record.

Learned counsel for the

plaintiff has submitted that the defendants were very well
aware of the facts that SITA had been amalgamated with
Kuoni by a judicial order but despite this defendant No. 1
has been accepting the subscription of SITA from Kuoni.
Prima facie this indicates that the membership subscription
was being paid by Kuoni and not by SITA. SITA ceased to
exist after its amalgamation with Kuoni. In the nomination
form filled by the plaintiff, he has given the name of his
organisation as SITA World Travel (India) Ltd. knowing it
well that this company did not exist. This is not disputed

CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 3 of 15

by the learned counsel for the plaintiff that in the
nomination form the name of the organisation of plaintiff
given is SITA and not Kuoni. Prima facie this itself is an
error committed by the plaintiff while filling in and
submitting the form. As alleged some one probably made a
complaint to the Returning Officer which resulted in
another scrutiny of the nomination form. The name of the
plaintiff for the post of Senior Vice President did exist in
the list of contestants issued by the defendant No. 1 on
22.11.2007.

However, on 3.12.2007 a letter was written

to the plaintiff by the Returning Officer seeking information
on the following:-

“Whether SITA does exist as
an independent travel body or
stand fully merged with Kuoni in
all respects.
Whether SITS too holds a
separate recognition as tour
operator by the Ministry of
Tourism, Government of India;
Grateful submit the audited
balance sheet of your company
for last two years duly certified
your Chartered Accountant for
our perusal please.”

5. This letter was duly replied by the plaintiff through his
counsel on 4.12.2007 informing the defendant No. 2 that
SITA World Travel (I) Pvt. Ltd. was merged with Kuoni in

CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 4 of 15

the year 2001 which was in the notice of IATO at that time
itself.

Plaintiff also claimed that he had been attending a

number of important meetings of IATO as Chief Operating
Officer of Kuoni.

As per his own reply, Kuoni had been

accepting the membership fees of SITA after its merger
with Kuoni. Prima facie it indicates that the membership
fees was always paid by Kuoni and not by SITA for the
simple reasons that SITA ceased to have existence after its
merger with Kuoni. Therefore, information given by the
plaintiff in nomination form was incorrect to his own
knowledge.

6. Clause

4A

of

MOA

defines

active

members

of

the

association which reads as below:-

“(a) Active Members: A firm
or company having established
place of business in India and
recognized by the Department of
Tourism as Tour Operator/Travel
Agent for a minimum period of
two year and its major substantial
part of activity of promotion of
tourism and foreign exchange
earnings in a year is minimum Rs.
20,00,000/- shall be eligible for
membership as an active member
of the association provided an
application is made and accepted
by the Executive Committee.
However only one office of a firm
or company shall be admitted as
an
Active
Member
of
the
CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 5 of 15

Association.”

7. Thus, it is clear that to be an active member of the
association

a

firm

or

a

company

must

have

been

recognized by the Department of Tourism as Tour Operator
for a minimum period of two years and its activities should
be for promotion of tourism. The other requirement is that
the said firm or company should have foreign exchange
earnings in a year minimum of Rs. 20,00,000/-. Vide letter
dated 3.12.2007, the third query was a demand for the
audit balance sheet of the company SITA for the last two
years duly certified by Chartered Accountant of the
company.

It seems that the said statement was never

submitted by the plaintiff. Prima facie this was one of the
reasons for cancellation of the nomination form of the
plaintiff.

8. Clause 10 of MOA of defendant No. 1 makes it clear that
the Executive Committee shall comprise members of the
association constituted as provided by the rules.

9. Learned counsel for the plaintiff has disputed the powers of
Returning Officer to re-scrutinize the nomination form after
it was accepted by the Executive Committee and reject the

CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 6 of 15

same.

Clause 11 of the MOA speaks about the manner in

which the elections are to be conducted. Relevant Clauses
11(e) & 13(m) for the purposes of present application read
as under:-

“11(e). The Election shall
be conducted by the Returning
Officer,
who,
shall
be
appointed/nominated
by
the
outgoing Executive Committee
simultaneously
with
the
announcement of the elections.
The Returning Officer upon being
appointed/nominated
by
the
Executive Committee shall begin
the conduct and holding of
elections by notifying the Active
members about the same.
13(m). Simultaneously with
the announcement for the holding
of
elections,
the
Executive
Committee
shall
nominate/appoint a Returning
Officer for the conduct and
holding of the elections and also
prepare and release the final list
of active member (as on the date
of announcement of elections)
which shall also be circulated by
the Secretary amongst the active
members of the Association.”

10.The Returning Officer, therefore, has to be appointed by
the outgoing Executive Committee and the Returning
Officer upon being appointed has to begin the conduct and
hold elections by notifying the active members about the
same.

When asked, it was conceded that the list of the

CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 7 of 15

active members of the Association is not available with the
plaintiff nor it has been placed on the record by either of
the parties. Once the election process has been started by
the Returning Officer it has to continue and cannot be
stopped by the interference of the Court.

Only remedy

available to the plaintiff is to challenge the validity of the
elections if he is not satisfied with the results of the
elections.

11.This Court in Meena Chaudhary Sharma v. New Delhi

Bar Association & Ors. bearing CS (OS) No. 174/2007
- decided on 30.3.2007 laid down the following general
principles of law relating to elections:-

“The general principle of
law relating to elections is that
the election process must be
completed and brought to its
logical conclusion and dispute
can be raised and adjudicated
only after the completion of the
entire
process
by
way
of
declaration of results.
The
election process starts with
taking the first step towards
holding the election, namely
appointed the Returning Officer
and fixing the election schedule in
the instant case.
Election
disputes are not just private civil
disputes between two parties.
Though there is an individual or a
few individuals arraigned as
parties before the Court, but the
CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 8 of 15

stakes of the constituency as a
whole (in the case of elections of
an Association, as in the instant
case, the stakes of the members
of the said Association) are on
trial.
Whichever way the list
terminates, it effects the fate of
the Association and the members
generally. A conscious approach
that overriding consideration for
welfare of the Association and
strengthening the democracy is
called for.
Neither turning a
blind eye to the controversies
which have arisen nor assuming a
role
of
every
enthusiastic
activities is permissible. The two
extremes have to be avoided in
dealing
with
the
election
disputes.
Furthermore, the
cardinal principle while deciding
election disputes is to see as to
whether the infirmities or the
discrepancies pointed out in the
election process are such which
would materially effect the result
of the election. Thus, in the field
of election jurisprudence, one has
to ignore those things which do
not materially effect the result of
election process. The Supreme
Court in the case of Election
Commission of India v. Ashok
Kumar, AIR 2000 SC 2977,
summed up the decision in law
after
referring
the
various
judgments and two Constitution
Bench judgments by laying down
the following five principles :“1) If an election, (the term
election being widely interpreted
so as to include all steps and
entire proceedings commencing
from the date of notification of
election
till
the
date
of
declaration of result) is to be
called in question and which
CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 9 of 15

questioning may have the effect
of interrupting, obstructing or
protracting
the
election
proceedings in any manner, the
invoking of judicial remedy has to
be postponed till after the
completing of proceedings in
elections.
2)
Any decision sought and
rendered will not amount to
calling in question an election if it
subserves the progress of the
election
and
facilitates
the
completion
of
the
election.
Anything
done
towards
completing or in furtherance of
the election proceedings cannot
be described as questioning the
election.
3)
Subject to the above, the
action taken or orders issued by
Election Commission are open to
judicial review on the well-settled
parameters which enable judicial
review of decisions of statutory
bodies such as on a case of
malafide or arbitrary exercise of
poser being made out or the
statutory body being shown to
have acted in breach of law.
4)
Without
interrupting,
obstructing
or
delaying
the
progress
of
the
election
proceedings, judicial intervention
is available if assistance of the
Court has been sought for merely
to correct or smoothen the
progress
of
the
election
proceedings, to remove the
obstacles therein, or to preserve
a vital piece of evidence if the
same would be lost or destroyed
or rendered irretrievable by the
time the results are declared and
stage is set for invoking the
jurisdiction of the Court.
5)
The Court must be very
CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 10 of 15

circumspect and act with caution
while entertaining any election
dispute though not hit by the bar
of Article 329 (b) but brought to
it during the pendency of election
proceedings.
The Court must
guard against any attempt at
retarding,
interrupting,
protracting or stalling of the
election proceedings. Care has to
be taken to see that there is no
attempt to utilise the courts
indulgence by filing a petition
outwardly
innocuous
but
essentially
a
subterfuge
or
pretext for achieving an ulterior
or hidden end. Needless to say
that in the very nature of the
things the Court would act with
reluctance and shall not act
except on a clear and strong case
for its intervention having been
made out by raising the pleas
with particulars and precision
and supporting the same by
necessary material.” (Emphasis
supplied)
It was further held:“Thus, normally the Court
has not to invoke judicial remedy
till after the completion of
proceedings in elections. When
an election is in process, the
Court is to be very circumspect
and act with caution.
Judicial
intervention is called for merely
to correct or smoothen the
process of election proceedings
or to remove the obstacles
therein or to preserve a vital
piece of evidence. Thus, while
the election process is on, the
Court would step in for ensuring
the proper completion of the
election
process.
Election
process culminates with the
CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 11 of 15

announcement of the results
thereof. The aforesaid judgment
was
in
the
context
while
interpreting the provisions of the
Representation of People Act and
the relevant provisions of the
Constitution
touching
the
elections of the Member of
Parliament in the Lok Sabha.
However,
the
principles
summarized above are generally
applicable to cases of all types of
elections of different nature of
bodies unless a particular case is
governed by specific stipulated
procedure
or
the
statutory
provisions.”

12.Similarly, in Abhay Kumar Verma v. Bar Council of

Delhi & Others – 2004 IV AD (Delhi) 329 , this Court
laid down the following five principles to be considered by
the Court while deciding to interfere or not to interfere in
the election of the association:-

“1) If an election, (the term
'election'
being
widely
interpreted so as to include all
steps and entire proceedings
commencing from the date of
notification of election till the
date of declaration of result) is to
be called in question and which
questioning may have the effect
of interrupting, obstructing or
protracting
the
election
proceedings in any manner, the
invoking of judicial remedy has to
be postponed till after the
completing of proceedings in
elections.
CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 12 of 15

2) Any decision sought and
rendered will not amount to
“calling in question an election” if
it subserves the progress of the
election
and
facilitates
the
completion
of
the
election.
Anything
done
towards
completing or in furtherance of
the election proceedings cannot
be described as questioning the
election.
3) Subject to the above, the
action taken or orders issued by
Election Commission are open to
judicial review on the well-settled
parameters which enable judicial
review of decisions of statutory
bodies such as on a case of mala
fide or arbitrary exercise of
power being made out or the
statutory body being shown to
have acted in breach of law.
4) Without interrupting,
obstructing
or
delaying
the
progress
of
the
election
proceedings, judicial intervention
is available if assistance of the
Court has been sought for merely
to correct or smoothen the
progress
of
the
election
proceedings, to remove
the
obstacles therein, or to preserve
a vital piece of evidence if the
same would be lost or destroyed
or rendered irretrievable by the
time the results are declared and
stage is set for invoking the
jurisdiction of the Court.
5) The Court must be very
circumspect and act with caution
while entertaining any election
dispute though not hit by the bar
of Article 329(b) but brought to it
during the pendency of election
proceedings.
The Court must
guard against any attempt at
retarding,
interrupting,
CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 13 of 15

protracting or stalling of the
election proceedings. Care has to
be taken to see that there is no
attempt to utilize the Court's
indulgence by filing a petition
outwardly
innocuous
but
essentially
a
subterfuge
or
pretext for achieving an ulterior
or hidden end. Needless to say
that in the very nature of the
things the Court would act with
reluctance and shall not act
except on a clear and strong case
for its intervention having been
made out by raising the pleas
with particulars and precision
and supporting the same by
necessary material.”

13.Coming back to the facts and circumstances of this case
even if on the face of it, the decision of the Returning
Officer cancelling the nomination of the plaintiff is deemed
as arbitrary and illegal, the Court has to keep in mind the
principles underlying the elections. Therefore, the election
process has to be completed and brought to its logical
conclusion and the disputes can be raised and adjudicated
upon only after the completion of the entire process by way
of declaration of results. Court has to ignore the individual
interest and see the stakes of the constituency as a whole
in the case of elections of the association. Whichever way
the list of approved candidates is terminated, it is likely to
affect the association as a whole and its members
generally.
CS(OS) No. 2462/2007

Page 14 of 15

14.Therefore, prima facie I do not find it a fit case where
judicial interference is required.

It is the interest of the

association which the Court has to look into and in case the
plaintiff is not satisfied with the election results, he has a
right to challenge the same in accordance with law.
Hence, at this stage, I do not find any reason to stay the
elections as prayed. The defendant shall hold the elections
as scheduled on 22.12.2007 and declare results; subject to
decision of the present case on merits.

15.Reply to this application be filed within four weeks.

Summons for settlement of issues be served upon the
defendants, returnable on 5th May, 2008.
Steps be taken within one week.
