The indictment

against

the

petitioner,

Sgt.

Ullash

Bhattacharjee, was as follows. While on the posted strength of 40
Wing, AF, he was staying in the house of Shri Shyam Singh, that
is, Shiv Colony, Pinto Park III. Gayatri Vihar Colony from 29th
November, 1998 till September, 1999 with his wife Smt.Munmun
Bhatacharjee and their child.

Petitioner’s wife Smt. Munmun

Bhatacharjee had contacts with Shri Sushil Kumar and his friend
Shri Kailash. She used to gather classified/sensitive information
on service matter from the petitioner, neighbours and friends
which was in petitioner’s knowledge, and passed it on to her
friends Shri Sushil Kumar and Shri Kailash both of whom were
stated to be Pak Intelligence agents and were not authorized to
receive such information.

The petitioner failed to intimate the

service authorities about the above-said fact. He was dismissed
from service vide order dated 10th February, 2003 under Section

WP(C) No.11357/2004

Page 2 of 4

20(1) of the Air Force Act, 1950 read with Rule 18 of the Air Force
Rules, 1969. Under these circumstances, the instant writ petition
was filed with a prayer that the order dated 10 th February, 2003
be quashed being a non-speaking order passed under unguided
statutory provision in erroneous and arbitrary manner.
further prayed that the petitioner be reinstated

It was

with all

consequential benefits.
2.

The main contention of the learned counsel for the

petitioner is that the alleged confession made by the petitioner is
not voluntary.

He was compelled to make it with a view to

striking him off from the strength of Indian Air Force. The abovesaid confession was made under force, undue influence and
coercion.
3.

We have gone through the above-said confession.

This

confession clearly goes to show that the petitioner has admitted
his guilt without ifs and buts.

It must be borne in mind that

confession is a direct acknowledgement of guilt by accused
himself. The argument urged by counsel for the petitioner that
this confession was obtained under duress, threat or promise is
neither credible nor trustworthy in absence of any evidence to

WP(C) No.11357/2004

the contrary. Another notable factor is that this fact does not find
place in the reply submitted by the petitioner against show cause
notice dated 9th December, 2002.

It appears to be an

afterthought and no weight can be pinned thereto. The petition
is without force and therefore, the same is dismissed.
4.

However, it was also brought to our notice that the

petitioner has moved an application to the Chief of the Air Force
Staff dated 16th September, 2003, wherein he has prayed that he
should be granted service benefits like pension, provident fund
and A.F.Group Insurance amount.

It is also averred that the

minimum pensionable service is 15 years whereas at the time of
commission of the above-said offence the petitioner had already
completed service of 18 years. It is explained that the petitioner
has not received response to the said application. We hereby
direct the Chief of the Air Staff to decide his above application
within two months from today.

A copy of this order be given

dasti to both counsel for parties.
