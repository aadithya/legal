1.

The petitioner, UOI, by this petition under Article 226

of the Constitution of India challenge the order passed by the
Central Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi (for
short

`the

Tribunal'),

in

O.A.No.1680/2004

and

MA

No.1421/2004, dated 15th July, 2004 and the order dated 22nd
March, 2005 passed in C.P.No.506/2004. By the first order, the
Wpc 12468.05

page 1 of 17

Tribunal allowed the aforesaid OA, without issuing notice to the
petitioner, by directing that the petitioner may give due
consideration to the case of the respondent in the light of the
decision of the Tribunal in O.A.89/2004, dated 14.1.2004, and to
dispose of the claim of the respondent by passing a reasoned
and speaking order within a period of two months. By the order
dated 22nd March, 2005 passed in C.P.No.506/2004, the Tribunal
gave a further direction to the petitioner to consider the claim of
the respondent in the light of the orders passed in compliance of
O.A.No.89/2004 dated 13.9.2004, by passing a detailed and
speaking order within two months.

2.

The respondent had preferred the aforesaid O.A

No.1680/2004 before the Tribunal claiming arrears of pay for the
period when they ought to have been made temporary, i.e after
rendering continuous 120 days of casual labour, till the date they
were in fact granted temporary status. Their submission was
that, as per Railway Board's circular

dated 30.6.1981,

they

were entitled to temporary status and privileges as per Chapter
XXIII of the Indian Railway Establishment Manual (IREM) upon
completion of 120 days of continuous service as casual labour. It
was claimed that they had been initially appointed between the

Wpc 12468.05

page 2 of 17

years 1973 and 1984 and granted temporary status only the
years 1979 to 1990. The relevant dates in respect of each of the
respondent as given in para 4.3 of the O.A. The respondent's
case was that in similar cases i.e. O.A.No.2610/02, Ram Dulare
& Ors v. UOI & O.A.No. 1031/03, Shri Nand Kishore & Ors v.
UOI & Ors., the Tribunal had allowed the same relief, and
consequently they were also entitled to the said relief.

3.

When the aforesaid OA of the respondents came up

for preliminary hearing, the Tribunal, without notice to the
petitioner allowed the same relying upon its earlier judgment
and order dated 14th January, 2004 passed in O.A.No.89/2004,
Shri Dhani Ram & Ors. v UOI & Others, with the following
direction:-

“Having regard to the facts as submitted by
the applicants in this Original Application and
also the specific submission made by the
learned counsel for the applicants that the
case is covered under the decision as given by
this Tribunal in the above said O.A. I am of the
view that the ends of justice will be met if the
O.A is disposal of at the admission stage itself
without issuing notice to the respondents with
a direction that the reliefs as sought in this
O.A. may be given due consideration in the
light of the decision as relied upon by the
applicant and as has been referred to
hereinabove and to dispose it of by issuing a
reasoned and speaking order within a period of
Wpc 12468.05

page 3 of 17

two months from the date of receipt of a copy
of this order.”
4.

The petitioner sought extension of time for passing a

reasoned

order by filing M.A.Nos. 2065/2004 and 2066/2004,

since it was claimed that the relevant documents were not
available, and the respondent had also failed to file the same in
support of their claim.
granted further time

On 11th October, 2004, the Tribunal

of two months to implement the order

dated 15th July, 2004.

5.

The petitioner passed an order dated 18th January,

2005 rejecting the claim of the respondents for seeking
temporary status and

privileges as per Chapter XXIII of the

IREM. The ground for rejection stated was that the respondents
had

been

engaged

gangman/khalasi.

in

the

years

1975-1984

as

casual

No records, such as payment vouchers or

attendance registers are now available in the office to verify the
continuity of
destroyed

120 days service and the same have been
under prevalent office instructions.

Even the

respondents had not represented in the near past to consider
their claim for grant of temporary status after 120 days of
continuous service.

In substance, the petitioner stated that

there was no material available on record, and none had been
Wpc 12468.05

page 4 of 17

produced by the respondents to merit consideration of the claim
made by the respondents. The petitioner also relied upon the
judgment of the Supreme Court in Rattan Chandra Samanta
v. UOI, (1993) 3 SCC 671. In any event, the respondents were
also called upon to furnish documents to substantiate their claim
within 15 days.

6.

The respondents thereafter initiated C.P.No.506/2004

which was opposed by the petitioners. The aforesaid contempt
petition has been disposed of by the impugned order dated
22.3.2005 with the following direction:-

“Accordingly, CP is disposed of with a direction
to reconsider the claim of the applicants in the
light of their orders passed in compliance of
OA-89/2004 and 13.9.2004 by passing a
detailed and speaking order within two months
from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.
Notice are discharged. However, it shall not
preclude the applicants to revive this CP if they
are still aggrieved.”
7.

The submissions of the Petitioners are as follows:
i) The Tribunal ought not to have disposed of the
aforesaid O.A ex parte by issuing a direction to the
petitioners to consider the claim of the respondents
and pass a reasoned and detailed order by placing

Wpc 12468.05

page 5 of 17

reliance upon the order passed in O.A.No.89/2004
dated 14.1.2004.
issued

The Tribunal ought to have

notice to the

petitioners

to grant

an

opportunity to the petitioners to satisfy the Tribunal
that the case of the respondents was not similar in
facts to the case in O.A.No.89/2004.
ii) The Tribunal in any event, merely directed the
Petitioner to pass a reasoned and speaking order
and that order stood complied with passing of the
order by the Petitioner on 18.1.2005.
iii)The respondents had filed the aforesaid O.A after a
lapse of over 20 years from the date they claim to
have been initially engaged as casual workers. The
same was highly belated.
iv)The Petitioner is not averse to the grant of arrears
of pay from the date that the casual employees
ought to have been given temporary status after
they

had

worked

for

120

days

continuously.

However, the said relief cannot be granted in the
absence of any material or documentary proof. The
Petitioners have no existing records since the claim
Wpc 12468.05

page 6 of 17

has

been

raised

by

the

Respondents

highly

belatedly after about 20 years and the records are
not maintained for more than five years in terms of
office instruction No. PS-1666.
v) Moreover, the respondents failed to produce any
documentary evidence or material to substantiate
their claim, or to even enable the petitioner to
verify the authenticity of the claim made by the
respondents.

The respondents, of their own had

failed to provide any details about their alleged
engagement on casual basis, such as the place of
engagement, and the authority under whom they
were initially engaged as casual labourers, and
under whom they claimed to have completed 120
days of service in that capacity.
vi)The applicants of O.A. No. 89/2004 had given
complete details of their being engaged as casual
labourers and had also produced the relevant
documents on the basis of which their claims were
verified and found to be correct. It was on that basis
that they had been given benefit in terms of para
Wpc 12468.05

page 7 of 17

2005 of the Railway Establishment Manual, Volume
II.(This is so stated in the additional affidavit dated
29th August 2005, paragraph 4 and the Petitioner
also produced a copy of the judgment and order
passed by the Tribunal in O.A. No. 89/204 and MA
No.86/2004 to show that in that case the complete
details of the temporary employees were available).
vii)The only proof about the working period as casual
labour after grant of temporary status is the
payment voucher which is given to the concerned
daily wager, and the copy of the attendance
register. In the absence of these documents, it is
impossible to ascertain, whether the claim

is

justified, and if so from which date the arrears are
payable. Reliance is placed upon office instructions
PS-1666,

whereunder

the

specific

records

pertaining to the Respondents in the present case
had already been destroyed. (This is so stated in
the additional affidavit of the petitioner dated
14.2.2006)
viii)The Respondents are now taking advantage of the
Wpc 12468.05

page 8 of 17

aforesaid position and staking claims which could
not be verified. The Petitioner also gave reference
of other petitions stated to be pending before the
Tribunal raising issues of limitation and jurisdiction
in similar cases.
ix)The case of the Respondent is squarely covered by
the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the
case of Ratan Chand Samanta (Supra) wherein
similar circumstances, relief was denied to the
Petitioners since they had failed to provide any
proof

of

having

worked

as

casual

labourers

continuously for a period of 120 days and the
Supreme Court also refused to grant any further
opportunity to them to produce the requisite proof.
x) The Petitioner had in any case, while passing the
order dated 18.1.2005, granted further opportunity
to the Respondents to come forward with the
documentary proof, which they failed to avail of.
xi)The statement made by the Petitioners before the
Tribunal that they would implement the order
passed in the OA within two months while seeking
Wpc 12468.05

page 9 of 17

extension of time vide MA 2065 and 2066/2004 is in
consonance with the stand of the Petitioners that
they are not averse to granting relief to the
Respondents, provided the same is duly established
with documentary proof. The Respondents are
taking undue advantage of the fact that there are
no records available to verify their claims and the
possibility of the said claims being incorrect or
exaggerated cannot be ruled out.

8.

Despite notice, there has been no appearance on

behalf of Respondents. However, the stand of the Respondents,
as contained in their OA before the Tribunal has been perused.

9.

Having given our thoughtful consideration to the

matter, we are of the view that the impugned orders of the
Tribunal cannot be sustained in the face of the aforesaid decision
of the Supreme Court in Ratan Chand Samanta (Supra) and in
the facts of the present case.

10.

In Ratan Chand Samanta (Supra)

the casual

employees were seeking re-employment without taking any
steps to enforce their claim before the Railways, except sending
Wpc 12468.05

page 10 of 17

vague representations.

They did not produce any material to

satisfy the court that their case was covered by the scheme they
sought to place reliance upon. From the date of retrenchment,
more than 15 years had expired. The Court rejected the plea of
the petitioners to permit the employees to produce documents
to establish their claim after verification, on the ground that a
writ is issued in favour of a person who has some right, and not
for the sake of conducting a roving enquiry, leaving scope for
maneuvering. The Court held that delay itself deprives a person
of his remedy. In the absence of any fresh cause of action or
any legislation, a person who has lost his remedy with lapse of
time loses his right as well. The Court also held that in case the
claim of the casual employees is accepted, a host of other such
employees, who have in the meanwhile become eligible and are
entitled to claim employment, would be deprived.

In the

absence of any positive material to establish their claim, the
Supreme Court rejected the claim of the casual employees to
require the Railways to now verify the correctness of the
statement made by them that they were engaged on casual
basis between 1964 to 1969 and retrenched between 1975 to
1978.

Wpc 12468.05

11.

The admitted position is that the Respondents did not

furnish any detailed particulars which can be verified to establish
their claims. They did not file any documentary evidence to show
that they had worked as casual labourers continuously for a
period of 120 days. Their claims were made highly belated,
inasmuch as, they were granted temporary status between the
period 1979 and 1981 except in the case of Respondent No. 12
who was granted temporary status on 6.7.1990. They had
claimed their initial dates of appointment between the years
1973 and 1984. A perusal of para 4.3 of the OA shows that in
respect of some of the Respondents/applicants, the dates were
vaguely mentioned, inasmuch as, only the month and the year
when the initial appointments were claimed to have been made
were mentioned. In respect of Shri Radhey Krishan, respondent
no.8, only the year 1974 was mentioned and no further details
were mentioned. There were absolutely no documentary proofs
filed by the Respondent before the Tribunal. The Respondents
also did not dispute the fact that the Petitioners were not
possessed of any records which could be verified to establish
their claims. Their only argument was that similar relief had been
granted in other cases without insisting upon verifications of the
record. That, in our view, is no reason to grant the same relief to
Wpc 12468.05

page 12 of 17

the Respondents. The Respondents must stand on their own legs
and establish their right to claim the relief as claimed by them,
and cannot rely upon the fact that others have been granted the
same relief without verification of their claims. If others have
been granted the same relief without verification of their service
records, that was erroneous on the part of the Petitioner.
However, no case for discrimination can be made out on the
basis that some others have wrongly been granted the benefit or
relief which was not due to them (See AIR 2006 SC 2609).

12.

We are of the view that the Tribunal should be very

careful while issuing ex parte final directions to the authorities,
particularly where such directions are based on the assumption
that

the

applicants

case

is

covered

by

another

judicial

pronouncement of the Tribunal or the Court. Even if it appears
to the Tribunal that a matter is covered by another decision, it
would serve the interest of justice and be in consonance with the
principles of natural justice to give a short notice to the
respondents to place their stand before the Tribunal. After all, it
is always open to a party to try and satisfy the Court that in the
facts of his case, the earlier pronouncement is not applicable, or
that, the said pronouncement is itself erroneous, being in conflict

Wpc 12468.05

page 13 of 17

with or in ignorance of a decision of the Higher Court or the law.
In the present case, if the Tribunal had issued notice to the
petitioners herein, they would have brought to the notice of the
Tribunal the fact that the present case is on a different factual
footing from the one decided in O.A 89/2004; that in the present
case there

are no records

available, and none have been

produced by the respondents to verify their claims; and, that the
claim of the respondents as made were in the teeth of the
decision of the Supreme Court in Rattan Chand Samanta
(supra). It is quite likely, that if the Tribunal had the occasion to
consider these submissions, the Tribunal may not even have
issued the directions that it did by its ex parte impugned order.

13.

We also find force in the submission of the Petitioner

that the only direction issued by the Tribunal while disposing of
the OA on 15.7.2004 was that the Petitioner should pass a
speaking and reasoned order. That order was complied with.
With the passing of the order dated 18.1.2005 by the Petitioner,
in our view, the direction contained in the OA stood complied
with and consequently no action for contempt could have been
initiated against the Petitioner by the Tribunal. The submission
made by the Petitioner while seeking extension of time for

Wpc 12468.05

page 14 of 17

compliance of the order passed in OA to the effect that the
Respondents were considering the grant of benefits as prayed
for in the OA cannot, by itself, vest a right for the Respondents to
fasten liability upon the Petitioner. The said statement was
merely to the effect that they were considering the grant of the
benefit prayed for in the OA. That is not the same thing as to say
that they had decided to grant the benefit to the respondents.
The Petitioners were entitled to take a considered view on the
claim made by the Respondents in accordance with law. This is
exactly what the Petitioner did when the order dated 18.1.2005
was passed. If the Respondents were aggrieved by the order
dated 18.1.2005, it was open to them to have initiated a fresh
OA under Section 19 of the Administrative Tribunals Act.

The

stand of the Petitioner in the said communication was, to our
mind, fair and reasonable. They expressed the inability to grant
the relief claimed by the Respondent on account of non
availability of the record to verify the extremely stale claim of
the

Respondents

and

supported

their

decision

with

the

authoritative ruling of the Supreme Court aforesaid. Even in such
circumstances, the Respondents were granted yet another
opportunity

to

substantiate

their

claim

by

furnishing

documentary proof to establish that they had worked as casual
Wpc 12468.05

page 15 of 17

labourer for 120 days continuously. In our view, the Tribunal fell
in error in disregarding the fact that the Respondents were not in
a position to substantiate their claims and consequently they
were not entitled to any relief in view of the decision of the
Supreme Court in Ratan Chand Samanta (Supra).

14.

The respondents appear to have contended that the

petitioner was estopped from denying their claim for arrears of
pay. We do not see any force in this submission of the
respondents. Firstly, that there is no estoppel against the law.
Secondly, the respondents do not even say that the petitioners
made a representation, which they accepted and acted upon and
from which the petitioners have bactracked. Thirdly, the mere
proposal of the General Manager, even if one is assumed to have
been made by him, to waive the requirement of verification of
records does not vest the respondents with an enforceable right.
The petitioners, who are managing public wealth are bound to
verify each and every claim made before them in larger public
interest and cannot dole out largess, unless it is backed and
authorised by law. If unverified claims are allowed to be
entertained, large scale frauds and bogus claims are bound to
errupt, which will eat into tax payers money.

In view of the aforesaid, we set aside the orders

passed by the Tribunal in O.A. No. 1680/2004 MA No.1421/2004
dated 15th July 2004 and CP 506/2004 in OA 1680/2004 dated
22nd March 2005 and dismiss OA No.1680/2004 filed by the
Respondents. Parties are left to bear their respective costs.
