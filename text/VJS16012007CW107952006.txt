The prayer in these Writ Petitions is for issuance of an

appropriate writ or direction quashing the impugned order dated
24.4.2006 passed by the Land Acquisition Collector, who had
declined to make a Reference for enhancement of compensation
under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act (hereinafter
referred to as “the Act”) on the ground that the applications were
time barred. The second prayer is for issuance of writ or order in
W.P.(C) 10795-859/2006

PAGE 1 OF  11

the nature of mandamus directing the Land Acquisition Collector
to refer the dispute with respect to enhancement of compensation
under Section 18 of the Act to the court of the Additional District
Judge.
2.

The Award in this case was pronounced on 30.6.2004

in the presence of the Association, namely, Indraprakash
Apartment Occupants Association (hereinafter referred to as “the
Association”) of which the present petitioners were parties. After
the passing of the Award the Association addressed the letter
dated 14.7.2004 to the Land Acquisition Collector which reads as
follows:
“July 14, 2004
Land Acquisition Collector
New Delhi District
12/1, Jamnagar House
New Delhi
Sub: Acquisition of Land for DMRC of Indraprakash
Building, 21, Barakhamba Road, Indraprakash
Building, New Delhi-110001.
Dear Sir,
I
received
your
Notice
no.
F
9(1)/
LA/ND/CP/2003/2422 dated 25/06/04 as Secretary of
Indraprakash
Apartment Occupants Association
regarding personal presence of interested parties for
announcement of the award of our land acquired for
DMRC. Similar notices were also received by several
flat owners of Indraprakash Building who have filed
individual claims for compensation. I alongwith a
number of flat owners and office bearers of the
Association were present in your office on 30th June

'04 when you announced the said award.
connection, we have to state as under:-

In this

1) That the land on which the building
Indraprakash has been constructed
originally belong to Shri Jagmohan
Kapur, Shri Joginder Kapur, Shri Shiv
Kapur etc.
2) That Shri Jagmohan Kapur and others
entered into an agreement with M/s
Ansal for constructing the Indraprakash
Building and shared the build up area.
Kapurs and Ansals retained some of the
flats and sold the rest to different people.
3) That the present flat owners
purchased the flats in the Indraprakash
Building and have acquired ownership
rights in the building and the adjoining
land etc. for valuable consideration
under the Transfer of Property Act.
4) That the total land of 21 Barakhamba
Road is part and parcel of the
Indraprakash Building and each flat
owner holds a proportionate share in the
land of the building. Thus, the total land
of 21 Indraprakash Building is jointly
owned by all the flat owners including
Ansals and Kapurs in respect and in
proportion of the flats retained by them
proportionately.
5) That all the flat owners are having a
Flat Buyers Agreement duly executed
between them and the builders i.e. M/s
Ansals or Kapurs in respect of the flats
shared between them, as the case may
be.
6) That the owners have paid mutation
charges to the NDMC and mutation has
also been done in the records of NDMC.
7) That the Delhi Apartment Ownership
Act, 1986 and the Delhi Apartment
Ownership Rules in 1987 which has also
been notified vide Notification No. F. 16
(6)/76/LKB/Coord. Vol. III/1378 dated
W.P.(C) 10795-859/2006

PAGE 3 OF  11

November 30, 1987 also defines the
rights of the flat owners in the land and
other common areas etc.
8) That to the surprise of the flat owners
in the award on page no.10 line no.10, it
is stated that the L&DO has re-entered
on the land of Indraprakash Building
vide letter no. L&DO/L1-9/148(47)/3/294
dated 09/06/03. Neither the L&DO nor
the Kapurs or Ansals have informed the
flat owners about it and as such we are
not aware of the reasons as well.
9) That the flat owners having a legal
ownership and interest in the said land
of the building have not been notified
and as such is not possible to give any
comments in the matter.
It is observed that a sum of Rs. 57,38,229/- has been
assessed as the value of the structure boundary walls,
gates and other services for relocation and
reconstruction. All the utility services have been
shifted from the acquired land to the other side but
the same is incomplete in various aspect which have
been brought to the notice of Shri Jagmohan Kapur
who undertook the complete shifting of facilities and
services of the reconstruction work as per the order
passed by the honorable High Court of Delhi on
16/09/03 vide CWP No.5133/2003.
The price of the land assessed is much lower than the
market price. In order to arrive at fair market price
comparison have been made with the land prices in
Babar Lane, upper ground floor, mezzanine floor,
some plot no.64 in block no. 205 in Bengali market
which is not relevant to the land in front of the
buildings in Barakhamba Road.
In view of the above, we will be seeking legal remedy
for enhancing the compensation and payment of
compensation to the flat owners in proportion to their
holdings and request you not to release the amount of
compensation awarded by you either to L &DO or to
Kapurs' or any other claimant till the matter is finally
W.P.(C) 10795-859/2006

PAGE 4 OF  11

adjudicated by the court.
We also request you not to release the amount of
compensation to Shri Jagmohan Kapur for relocation
and transfer of services till they complete the work to
the satisfaction of the association, which represent
the flat owners.
Thanking you,
Yours truly,
R.Prasad
HONY SECRETARY
cc:Executive committee Members
Notice Board.”

Ms. Anusuya Salwan, learned counsel appearing for

the Petitioners, contends that on holistic reading of this letter it
would be evident that it complies with all the requirements of an
application under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act seeking
enhancement of compensation.

Avowedly no proforma of the

application under Section 18 of the Act has been prescribed.
Emphasis has been laid by learned counsel on the third last
paragraph of letter dated 14.7.2004 which makes a grievance of
applying land prices in Babar Lane and Bengali Market rather
than in respect of Barakhamba Road.
4.

Mr. Poddar, learned counsel appearing for the Land

Acquisition Collector, lays emphasis on the second last paragraph
of that letter which states that the Petitioners “will be seeking
W.P.(C) 10795-859/2006

PAGE 5 OF  11

legal remedy for enhancing the compensation”.

Mr. Poddar

contends that this communication pertains only to the non-release
of the compensation and not to a request under Section 18 of the
Act.

Predicated on these words he contends that no application

had in fact been made under Section 18 of the Act. He further
contends that after the pronouncement of the Award, CWP
No.13862/2004 and 13371-72/2004 had been filed in which the
prayers canvassed before us in this Petition, could easily have
been made.

He presses legal principles analogous and

assimilable to constructive res judicata to submit that the present
Petition should not be entertained.
5.

However, it has been explained by Ms. Salwan that

the threat that had been faced by the petitioners at that moment
of time was that the substantial part of the compensation was to
be released to the L & DO on the ground that the property had
been re-entered. On the first date of hearing interim orders have
been passed restraining the respondents from releasing any
compensation to the L& DO. In those proceedings, it transpired
that the subject compensation came to be deposited by the
Respondents in the Court of the Additional District Judge, New
Delhi, under Section 30/31 of the said Act. The apprehension of
the Petitioners that the compensation may have been released to

W.P.(C) 10795-859/2006

PAGE 6 OF  11

the L&DO was, therefore, allayed. The consequence was that the
Petitioners withdrew the said Writ Petitions.
6.

Mr. Poddar further draws our attention to the fact

that yet another series of Writ Petitions bearing No. W.P.(C)
13272/2005 & 13361/2005 had been filed by the Association and
some flat owners seeking a Reference under Section 18 of the
Act.

On 25.4.2006 this Court noted that the impugned order

dated 24.4.2006, rejecting the Petitioner's prayer for Reference
under Section 18 had been dismissed on grounds of being time
barred.

Those writ petitions were, therefore, permitted to be

withdrawn with liberty to assail the legal propriety of the said
order, and reserving to the Petitioners the right to raise all
grounds that had been taken in the said Writ Petitions. It is in
these circumstances that the present Writ Petition has been filed.
7.

Mr.

Poddar's

contention

that

the

principles

of

constructive res judicata should persuade us to dismiss the
present Writ Petition does not commend itself. The reasons for
filing the previous Petitions were either directed against the
perceived apprehension of release of the compensation to the
L& DO or for apportionment under Section 30, which had been
adequately answered by deposit of the compensation in the Court
of the Additional District Judge as contended by learned counsel

W.P.(C) 10795-859/2006

PAGE 7 OF  11

for the Petitioner.

What we have to consider, therefore, is

whether the letter dated 14.7.2004 can be construed as the action
envisaged under Section 18 of the Act. In this regard, we have
mentioned the fact that in proceedings in W.P.(C) 13272/2005
liberty had been granted by this Court to the individual owners to
move applications under Section 18 “in furtherance of the
application already moved through the Association”.

This would

have concluded the entire controversy but for the contention of
Mr. Poddar that the question had been raised even in those
proceedings that the letter dated 14.7.2004 could not be
construed as seeking a Reference under Section 18 of the Act. It
should not be ignored that even in interim proceedings as well as
in the petition before us it has not been contended that the
Association was incompetent to move an application under
Section 18 on behalf of its members.

This is for obvious reasons

since even at the stage of the pronouncement of the Award the
Association

had

been

specifically

taken

into

notice

and

communications had been addressed to it.
8.

Having

given

our

careful

consideration

to

the

arguments raised before us and having perused the letter dated
14.7.2004, we are of the opinion that it must be construed as a
request by the Association also on behalf of the Petitioners before

W.P.(C) 10795-859/2006

PAGE 8 OF  11

us to the Land Acquisition Collector to make a Reference under
Section 18 to the Additional District Judge. In this regard, we are
mindful of the views of the Supreme Court reiterated in Sushil

Kumar Sen v. State of Bihar [ (1975) 1 SCC 774] and State of
Punjab v. Shamlal Murari [(1976) 1 SCC 719], conveniently
digested by subsequent judgment in Kailash v. Nanhku [(2005)
4 SCC 480], the relevant portion of which reads as follows:
“28. All the rules of procedure are the handmaid of
justice. The language employed by the draftsman of
processual law may be liberal or stringent, but the
fact remains that the object of prescribing procedure
is to advance the cause of justice. In an adversarial
system, no party should ordinarily be denied the
opportunity of participating in the process of justice
dispensation.
Unless compelled by express and
specific language of the stature, the provisions of
CPC or any other procedural enactment ought not to
be construed in a manner which would leave the
court helpless to meet extraordinary situations in the
ends of justice. The observations made by Krishna
Iyer, J. in Sushil Kumar Sen v. State of Bihar are
pertinent: (SCC p. 777, paras 5-6)
“The mortality of justice at the
hands of law troubles a judge's
conscience
and
points
an
angry
interrogation at the law reformer.
The processual law so dominates in
certain
systems
as
to
overpower
substantive rights and substantial justice.
The humanist rule that procedure should
be the handmaid, not the mistress, of
legal justice compels consideration of
vesting a residuary power in judges to act
ex debito justitiae where the tragic
sequel otherwise would be wholly
inequitable.... Justice is the goal of
W.P.(C) 10795-859/2006

PAGE 9 OF  11

jurisprudence -processual, as much as
substantive.”
29. In State of Punjab v. Shamlal Murai the Court
approved in no unmistakable terms the approach of
moderating into wholesome directions what is
regarded as mandatory on the principle that: (SCC p.
720)
“Processual law is not to be a tyrant but
a servant, not an obstruction but an aid to
justice. Procedural prescriptions are the
handmaid and not the mistress, a
lubricant, not a resistant in the
administration of justice.”
In Ghanshyam Dass. v. Dominion of India the Court
reiterated the need for interpreting a part of the
adjective law dealing with procedure alone in such a
manner as to subserve and advance the cause of
justice rather than to defeat it as all the laws of
procedure are based on this principle.
9.

It is for these reasons that the reliance by Mr.Poddar

on Mahadeo Bakorap Patil v. State of Maharashtra and

others [2005 (7) SCC 440], in particular to para 14 thereof, does
not create any impediment in the passing of the aforementioned
orders. The said decision recognizes the absence of any power
with the Land Acquisition Collector to consider a time barred
action under Section 18 of the Act. We say this because as soon
as the communication dated 14.7.2004 is construed to be
sufficiently compliant with Section 18 of the Act, the question of
limitation does not arise at all, inasmuch as Section 18(2) of the
Act prescribes a period of six weeks for moving the said action,
W.P.(C) 10795-859/2006

PAGE 10 OF  11

commencing from the date of the Award.

Mr. Poddar contends

that this communication pertains only to the non-release of the
compensation and not to a request under Section 18 of the Act.
We cannot agree with him in view of the interpretation given by
us to the secondary paragraphs of the said letter.
10.

In these circumstances, the Writ Petitions are

allowed. The impugned order dated 24.4.2006 is set aside. The
letter dated 14.7.2004 shall be treated as a request for a
Reference under Section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act.
Mandamus will, therefore, issue to the Respondents to take
requisite steps to ensure that the Reference is made to the court
of Additional District Judge, Delhi forthwith. Petition is allowed
but there shall be no order as to costs.
