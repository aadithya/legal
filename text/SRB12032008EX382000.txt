EX.P. 38/2000

1 of 10

2.

The facts necessary to dispose of these applications are

that the decree holder had invoked an arbitration clause in an
agreement entered into with one M/s.Radiant Sports Management (P)
Ltd. - (Judgment Debtor No.1 in the present proceedings). An award
was made in its favour on 24.8.1998. In terms of the award, decree
holder was entitled to recover the sum of Rs.11,05,000/- and
Rs.5,07,534/- as damages from 24.11.1996 till date of payment; in
addition, the Arbitrator awarded interest at the rate of 15% per
annum on the amounts payable on due dates till their realization with
cost quantified at Rs.25,000/-.

The decree holder preferred the

present proceeding, i.e Execution Petition No.38/2000 on 14.2.2000.
In the body of the execution, the decree holder sought for attachment
of immovable property bearing No.S-524, Greater Kailash-I, New
Delhi, claiming that it was owned by the judgment debtor.
3.

On the strength of the averments and the contentions, this

Court by its order dated 16.5.2000 attached the property bearing
No.S-524, Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi.

Thereafter, a number of

occupants in the property had moved the Court, claiming to be
owners of different portions.
4.

During subsistence of the attachment orders in the

present proceedings, one Mr.Aushim Khetrapal appeared in the Court
and filed an affidavit on 27.9.2002 along with an application,

EX.P. 38/2000

2 of 10

i.e. EA 438/2002.

The said application stated that the judgment

debtor had come for want to settle the matter with the decree holder.
It further contained the following averments:-

"5.
The judgment debtor in full and final
settlement has agreed to pay a sum of
Rs.11,00,000/- in the manner stated hereunder
and the decree holder has accepted the same
in full and final settlement.
i)
Rs.1,54,000/- by way of pay order dated
26/9/02.
ii)
Rs.1,46,000/- by way of Pay Order dated
26/9/02.
iii)
Rs.2,00,000/- by way of cheque dated
30/9/02 bearing No.515952 drawn on HDFC
Bank.
iv)
Rs.2,00,000/- by way of cheque dated
3/10/02 bearing No.515953 drawn on HDFC
Bank.
v)
Rs.2,00,000/- by way of cheque dated
5/10/02 bearing No.515954 drawn on HDFC
Bank.
vi)
Rs.2,00,000/- by way of cheque dated
8/10/02 bearing No.515955 drawn on HDFC
Bank.
6.
The judgment debtor further agrees to
give the pay orders for the four cheques
mentioned above before their due date. If the
judgment debtor fails to give the pay order
then the decree holder will be entitled to
present the cheques on due dates. Further if
on presentation the cheques issued by him are
dishonoured then the entire decretal sum of
Rs.23,88,565/- along with interest @ 15% p.a.
from 10.2.2000 till the date of payment shall
become due and payable and the judgment
debtor shall be bound by the same.
7.
The judgment debtor agrees that the
above stated settlement is subject to the
condition that the payment schedule stated
EX.P. 38/2000

3 of 10

above would be strictly adhered to by the
judgment debtor.
8.
It is further agreed that if even one
installment is delayed or is not paid then the
entire decretal sum in terms of the decree
would become due and payable immediately
on default and the judgment debtor will be
liable to make the payment of the entire sum
of Rs.23,88,565/- along with interest @ 15%
p.a. from 10.2.2000 till the date of payment to
the decree holder.
9.
That the judgment debtor further agrees
and admits that till the entire payment in
terms of the settlement above is paid to the
decree holder he shall not sell, alienate,
transfer or part with possession of the
premises bearing No.S-524, Greater Kailash-I,
New Delhi and till payment of the last
installment upto 10/10/02."

5.

Paragraph 3 of the above affidavit stated that the

deponent would be bound by terms stated in the application and in
case of default, would also be liable to satisfy the decree holder. The
said Mr.Aushim Khetrapal also enclosed a copy of a Board Resolution
of the judgment debtor dated 23.9.2002.
6.

Apparently, the property bearing No. S-524, Greater

Kailash-I, New Delhi, was, at that stage, owned by one Shri
D.D.Khaitan. He sold it to Shri Aushim Khetrapal and his wife, Mrs.
Anita Khetrapal on 4.1.2001. The various sale deeds placed on the
record indicate that on 11.11.2002, the said Shri Aushim Khetrapal

EX.P. 38/2000

4 of 10

sold the property to one Shri Rahul Mullick. The latter further sold
the property on 19.12.2003 to the applicant in EA 213/2004, Shri Jai
Kumar Manghanani.
7.

All the above facts were, however, not brought to the

notice of the Court. The attachment order continued to subsist. On
10.7.2003, this Court directed sale of property bearing No.S-524,
Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi.

Subsequently, a proclamation was

made pursuant to an order dated 10.2.2004; as a result, 25.5.2004
was fixed as the date of auction. In the meanwhile, the Objector in EA
213/2004 approached the Division Bench in an appeal being
EFA No.16-17/2004.

On 24.5.2004, the Division Bench issued an

interim order suspending the order and staying the auction to be held
on next date. The decree holder and the auction purchaser (who is
before the Court now seeks to withdraw the offer) assert that they
were unaware of the order and that the auction proceeded in respect
of the second floor of the property.

The applicant in EA 213/2004,

Shir Jai Kumar Manghanani, therefore, approached this Court and
again obtained orders.

Eventually, the appeal was disposed of on

4.10.2004 confirming the stay of the auction granted on 24.4.2004, till
disposal of the applications filed by Shri Manghanani.
7.

The applicant in EA 198/2005, who had apparently

successfully bid for the property, sought for release of the property.

EX.P. 38/2000

5 of 10

In the later application, i.e. EA 38/2008, he has approached the Court
seeking to withdraw the offer in light of the Division Bench order.
8.

This Court has heard contentions of the parties. Counsel

for the decree holder contended that the title to the property was with
Shri Aushim Khetrapal at the relevant time and that the attachment
order was made validly when the execution petition was filed.

He,

therefore, submitted that the Court was justified in directing the
auction.

He also submitted that the liability of the Company was

taken over by Shri Aushim Khetrapal, who agreed to pay all the
outstandings even in his personal capacity as stipulated in the
undertaking which was filed in Court.

He undertook through his

affidavit

the

to

personally

discharge

liabilities

of

the

Company/judgment debtor by or in relation to the said property.
Therefore, the Court acted in accordance with law in attaching the
properties and seeking to sell them.
9.

Counsel for the Objector - Shri Manghanani, on the other

hand, contended that the order of attachment cannot be sustained
since the property did not belong to the Company.

It was also

submitted that in the absence of determination of the liability of Shri
Aushim Khetrapal or even acceptance of the affidavit furnished by
him, the attachment order was not valid. The title to the property was
with the different people.

EX.P. 38/2000

The occupiers of the floor from Shri Jai

6 of 10

Kumar Manghanani, too had filed objections which found favour with
the Court; and were later allowed during the pendency of the present
proceedings.
10.

Mr.R.C.Chopra, appearing on behalf of Shri Rajinder

Singh Verma, purchaser in the auction sale, submitted that although
initially the auction purchaser was interested in the property, he has
now no interest to pursue with the proceedings and wishes to
withdraw the amount deposited in the Court in view of the dispute
regarding title.

It was that contended, according to the auction

purchaser, the judgment debtor does not have any title to the
property or salable interest which can be conveyed and, therefore, the
auction purchaser wishes to withdraw the offer.
11.

It is evident from the above narrative that the decree in

question saddled liabilities on the judgment debtor, i.e. M/s. Radiant
Sports Management (P) Ltd.

Although execution proceedings were

initiated in 2000 and an attachment order was made on 16.5.2000, it
has never been disputed in these proceedings that the said judgment
debtor did not own the property No.S-524, Greater Kailash-I.

The

entire basis for the order of sale, the subsequent proclamation and
indeed the auction held on 25.5.2004 was the undertaking in the form
of an application filed by Shri Aushim Khetrapal on 27.9.2002. There
is indeed no order of this Court accepting the prayer in that

EX.P. 38/2000

7 of 10

application, i.e. EA 438/2002. The notice on the said application was
issued and the order sheets of 30.9.2002, 10.10.2002 and 8.11.2002
indicate that time was sought to file a reply. Thereafter, the order
sheets nowhere reflect consideration of the said application.

The

Court appears to have been persuaded to accept the contentions
based on the undertaking and proceeded on an assumption that the
property belonged to the judgment debtor and that the undertaking of
the affidavit of said Shri Aushim Khetrapal had been accepted.
12.

It is settled law that a Company has a separate juristic or

artificial existence apart from its Directors and members.

The

execution application has not disclosed how the property bearing
No.S-524, Greater Kailash-I, New Delhi, was connected with the
judgment debtor or that any part of it was owned by it.

The mere

circumstance that a Director of the judgment debtor owned a portion
of the property at some stage could not have, in the circumstances,
clothed this Court with the authority to issue an attachment order and
later to sell that property. There could be a case that where the Court
even in an execution proceeding “lifts the veil” of a closely held
Company, particularly, a private limited company and in order to
satisfy a decree, proceeds against the personal assets of its directors
and share holders. But before such a course of action is adopted, the
Court has to be satisfied about the need to follow such a course and

EX.P. 38/2000

8 of 10

return appropriate findings in that regard. All these are absent in the
present proceeding.

Therefore, I have no hesitation in concluding

that the attachment and the subsequent orders directing auction of
the property had no legal basis.
13.

In the light of the above findings, this Court is of the

opinion that EA No.213/2004 and 339/2004 have to succeed.

The

auction purchaser too has now come forward and sought the liberty of
the Court to withdraw the offer. In the circumstances of the case, the
order to put the property to auction cannot be sustained. Therefore,
EA 38/2008 has to be allowed.
14.

In the light of the above discussion, the order dated

16.5.2000 attaching the property is hereby vacated. EA 313/2006,
339/2004, 198/2005, 38/2008 and 338/2004 are accordingly allowed.
It is open to the auction purchaser

Shri Rajinder Singh Verma to

withdraw the amount deposited in this Court along with the interest
paid on it. All subsequent orders for sale, issuance of proclamation,
etc. are hereby set aside.
15.

In the circumstances the cost of the proceedings shall be

borne by the decree holder.

The decree holder shall also pay an

amount of Rs.50,000/- as costs to the applicant in EA No.213/2004
and 339/2004, i.e. Shri Jai Kumar Manghanani within four weeks.
16.
