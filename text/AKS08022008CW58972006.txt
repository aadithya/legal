1.Whether Reporters of Local papers may be allowed to
see the Judgment?

3.Whether the judgment should be reported in the Digest?

A.K. SIKRI, J.
:
1. Common question of law based on same set of facts is
involved in these cases. It was precisely for this reason that
all these petitions were heard together, though different
counsel appeared on behalf of the petitioners and the
respondents were also represented by many counsel.
2. All the petitioners were in the service of the Indian Army and
retired before 1.1.1996.

All these petitioners are getting

disability pension as they were invalidated out of service
due to some injury or disease which was treated as
attributable to and/or aggravated by military service. At the
relevant time when these petitioners retired, there was a
formula prescribed by the Government for fixation of
disability pension which, inter alia, provided fixation of such
a pension on the basis of actual percentage of disability
suffered by the official.
3. It is a matter of common knowledge that the Government of

WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 2 of 23

India constitutes Pay Commission generally after a gap of
every 10 years to go into the exercise of revision of pay
scales admissible to Central Government staff. The exercise
undertaken by such Central Pay Commissions include the
Defence Forces as well. Fifth Central Pay Commission thus
constituted, gave its report which was implemented with
certain modifications by the Government of India, with effect
from 1.1.1996.

In respect of armed forces, Ministry of

Defence took the decision on the recommendation of the
said Pay Commission regarding disability pension/war injury
pension/special

family

pension/liberalised

family

pension/dependent pension/liberalised dependent pension
vide orders dated 31.1.2001. Apart from providing revision
in the various kinds of pensions mentioned above, one
significant recommendation which was given nod by the
Central Government in the aforesaid communication was
prescribing

modified

formula

for

computing

disability

element of pension. The new formula which is contained in
Para 7.2 of the aforesaid communication dated 31.1.2001
reads as under:"7.2.Where an Armed Forces personnel
is invalided out under circumstances
mentioned in Para 4.1 above, the
extent of disability or functional
incapacity shall be determined in the
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 3 of 23

following manner for the purposes of
computing the disability element:Percentage
of
disability
as
Percentage
to
be
reckoned
assessed
by
invaliding
for
computing of disability medical
board element
less than 50
between 50 to 75
between 76 to 100

50
75
100

4. As per the revised formula, if the percentage of disability is
assessed at less than 50%, for the purpose of computing the
pension, the disability element is to be taken at 50%.
Thereafter, even if the disability is assessed at 20%,
disability element would be reckoned for the purpose of
computing at 50%. Likewise, if the disability is assessed at,
say, 60%, it is reckoned at 75%. Disability above 75% is to
be taken as 100%. This is a benevolent provision introduced
to benefit such of the armed forces personnel who invalidate
out of service as a result of disability suffered due to
circumstances attributable/aggravated by military service.
Same yardstick is fixed also for giving benefit to the
dependents of those who die under the circumstances
attributable/aggravated by military service.

As per the

earlier formula noted above, if an official suffered disability,
say, of 20%, his disability element of pension was computed
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 4 of 23

after taking into consideration 20% of the disability whereas,
under the revised formula it is to be taken as 50%. Thus, all
such military personnel invalidated out of service are going
to be benefited by this revised formula.
5. The problem is, however, created by Para 2.1 of the said
communication which has fixed the cut off date of 1.1.1996,
i.e. that the beneficial formula of fixation of disability
element of pension would be applicable only to those who
were in service on 1.1.1996 or joined thereafter as is clear
from the reading of this para:"2.1.The provisions of this letter shall
apply to the Armed Forces personnel who
were in service on 1.1.1996 or joined/join
service thereafter unless
otherwise
specified in this letter."
6. All these petitioners, as mentioned above, retired before
1.1.1996 and, therefore, they were not in service as on that
date.

In their case, therefore, the disability element of

pension, which was fixed as per the erstwhile formula, would
continue.

The petitioners contend that this amounts to

hostile discrimination, as two classes are sought to be
created, namely, those who retired before 1.1.1996 and
those who retired after 1.1.1996.

According to the

petitioners, this is not reasonable classification as both the

avowed

Therefore, they

have prayed for quashing of the fixation of cut off date of
1.1.1996 as unreasonable and have asked for revision of
their disability element of pension on the same formula as
provided in Para 7.2 extracted above.
7. Before we come to the legal submissions on the basis of
which plea is advanced, the factual basis on which this plea
is founded may first be noted.

It is pointed out that the

purpose for which the Central Government had constituted
Fifth Pay Commission vide its resolution dated 9.4.1994 and
is incorporated in the report of the Fifth CPC as well was the
following:"No.5(12) E-III/93.
The government of
India have been considering for some
time past changes that have taken place
in the structure of emoluments of
Government employees over the years.
Conditions have also changed in several
respects since the last pay commission
made its report in 1986. Accordingly, it
has been decided to appoint the Fifth
Central Pay Commission....".
8. It is stated that keeping the above resolution in view, the
Central Government gave Terms of Reference to the Pay
Commission. One of the terms given to the 5th Central Pay
Commission by Central Government and which is contained
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 6 of 23

in para 1.13(c), page 4 in Vol. I is "To examine with a view to
having a proper pension structure for pensioners, the
existing pension structure including death cum retirement
benefits and make recommendations relating thereto which
may be desirable and feasible."
9. The 5th Central Pay Commission in its recommendations on
rationalizing Disability Pension has stated in para 164.7,
page 2017, Vol. III that there is a need to fix a suitable
minimum disability element for service personnel as distinct
from the minimum for civilians.

Therefore, in order to

ensure uniformity and to provide a higher benefit, disability
element for service personnel may also be calculated as a
percentage of pay for 100% disability. It is stated in para
164.8 of the same report "We also feel that some
rationalisation with regard to the degree of disablement is
also required as the existing system is prone to delays. We
suggest that for personnel boarded out of service due to
disability, attributable to service, the minimum disability
element should be reckoned as 50% irrespective of what it
actually is ....".

The Commission further recommended,

"....Where it is not feasible to retain such personnel, a
minimum disability element calculated at 50% may be paid.
For individuals who are boarded out and degree of disability
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 7 of 23

is assessed between 50% and 75% disability element may
be authorized at 75% and for more than 75% disability, the
element should be calculated at 100%. Thus, there will be
broad-banding of the extent of disability and the likelihood
of mistakes on disagreements would be minimum.
10.Submission is that it is quite clear from the above
mentioned

Central Government had felt the necessity to change the
pension structure as it existed on 9.4.1994 because it
suffered from drawbacks and wanted to have a proper
pension structure and asked the Pay Commission to make
recommendations which were desirable and feasible. At this
point in time it was not the desire of Central Government to
create two pension structures, instead the Government
wanted to rationalize the existing structure so that its
benefits could accrue to all pensioners. Accordingly, the 5th

it was not the recommendation of the

Pay Commission that the old structure which was suffering
from some infirmities be continued in respect of pensioners
who were invalided out before a certain date and the new

The

Commission had recommended only one pension structure,
to be made applicable uniformly to all the pensioners
irrespective of their dates of invalidment.

that this decision of the Central Government is irrational and
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 9 of 23

arbitrary.
11.It is on the basis of the aforesaid factual matrix that the
petitioners contend that the respondents have divided a
homogeneous class of pensioners, who are entitled to
disability pension, into two different sub classes which is
violative of the letter and spirit of Article 14 of the
Constitution, as it is not based on any rational principles and
is wholly unrelated to the objectives sought to be achieved
by revising old pension structure. It is the submission that
the eligibility criteria as contained in Para 2.1 of the
Government of India letter dated 31.1.2001 and 16.5.2001
fixing the cut off date of 1.1.1996 is, therefore, arbitrary and
discriminatory in view of ration of law laid down by the
Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court in the case of
D.S. Nakara and Others Vs. Union of India,

[1983] 2 SCR

165. Learned counsel for the respondent also rested their
case on the judgment of the Apex Court in Subrata Sen and
Others Vs. Union of India and Others, 2001 SCC (L&S) 1237
wherein the principles contained in D.S. Nakara (supra) was
reiterated and such a cut off date for applicability of revised
pension scheme therein was struck down.
12.The respondents, on the other hand, have sought to justify
the fixation of cut off date primarily on the ground that with
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 10 of 23

the change of formula there is going to be a huge financial
implication and this is an important reason and rational
behind fixing the cut off date.

It is, thus, submitted that

once a different yardstick is laid down fixation of disability
element of pension. It is open to the Government to fix a
particular date from which such a benefit would accrue to
the persons and, therefore classification is reasonable.
Those officials who retired prior to 1.1.1996 formed a
different group than those who retired or are going to retire
after 1.1.1996. It is the submission of the respondents that
in Union of India Vs. P.N. Menon 1994 [4] SCC 68, the
Supreme Court held that:-

“It is not always possible to extend the same
benefits to one and all, irrespective of the
dates of superannuation.
As such any
revised scheme in respect of post retirement
benefits, if implemented with a cut off date
which can be held to be reasonable and
rational in the light of Article 14 of the
Constitution, need not be held to be invalid.
It shall not amount to “picking out a date
from the hat”. Whenever a revision takes
place, a cut off date becomes imperative
because the benefit has to be allowed within
the financial resources available with the
Government."
13.It is further submitted that the entire case of the petitioner
is based on a fallacy that the Government cannot fix a cut
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 11 of 23

off date for extending the post retirement benefits as doing
the same would amount to cause a vertical division among a
homogeneous class of persons. However, they have failed
to appreciate that extension of such benefits has its own
pecuniary implications and while taking a decision about the
implementation of such a scheme these implications have to
be borne in mind. It is submitted that the impugned letters
were issued in pursuance of the recommendations of the 5th
Pay Commission and these recommendations were brought
into effect from 1.1.1996. As such, no vertical division has
been caused among the class of disability pensioners. The
Supreme Court once again upheld the fixing of cut off date
for extending the post retirement benefits in P.K. Kapur Vs.
Union of India & Others, JT 2007 (III) SC 98.
14.We have given our due considerations to the aforesaid
submissions made by counsel on either side.
15.It would be advisable to start the discussion keeping in
view the judgment of the Supreme Court in P.K. Kapur Vs.
Union of India & Others (supra).

Not only it is the most

recent judgment on the subject rendered on 1.2.2007, what
is important is that in this judgment same very circular letter
dated 31.1.2001 came up for consideration by the Apex
Court. The issue of fixation of cut off date of 1.1.1996 was
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

also considered.
16.In that case, the appellant stood superannuated from the
Indian Army on 30.11.1989.

He was entitled to war

disability pension which he started getting from the said
date of retirement.

Before his retirement his war injury

disability was assessed at 30% (permanent and for life). It
may, however, be noted that he was not prematurely
invalidated out of service because of the said war injury
which he suffered in 1965 while fighting in Jammu and
Kashmir Sector against Pakistani troops. He was retained in
service, granted permanent commission and was allowed to
work

till

30.11.1989

when

he

was

released

on

superannuation on completion of 51 years of age after
putting in qualifying service of 26 years.

The disability

pension which was granted to him was calculated on the
basis of disability assessed at 30%. In the writ petition filed
by him in this Court, one of the reliefs sought by him, with
which

we

are

concerned,

was

that

in

view

of

the

recommendation of the 5th Pay Commission, the disability
should be treated as 50% as per notification dated
31.1.2001. He made this complaint on the same basis which
is made by the petitioners herein, namely, cut off date of
1.1.1996 could not have been fixed by the respondents,
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 13 of 23

which was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution having
regard to the law laid down by the Supreme Court in the
case of D.S. Nakara (supra). The precise argument, which
was raised by him in this behalf, is noted by the Supreme
Court in para 6 of the judgment, which is reproduced below:“6. Now, coming to the second challenge
concerning “enhancement of percentage
of disability”, appellant has submitted
that Government of India had vide O.M.
dated 3.2.2000 enhanced the percentage
of disability for Armed Forces officers
including junior officers in service on or
after 1.1.96. Since, the appellant retired
on
30.11.89
this
enhancement
of
percentage
of
disability
was
not
admissible in the case of the appellant.
Appellant submitted that there was no
reason for denying enhancement of
percentage of disability to junior officers
in the Indian Army who retired prior to
1.1.96. Fixation of this cut-off date of
1.1.96, according to the appellant, is
arbitrary, irrational and violative of Article
14
of
the
Constitution.
Appellant
submitted that one of the facets of Article
14 is that it eschews arbitrariness in any
form. Appellant submitted that this Court
in the case of Nakara (supra) has
observed that Article 14 condemns
discrimination in any form. He submitted
that there is no rational for excluding
officers from the benefit of enhancement
merely because they stood retired prior to
1.1.96. Appellant, therefore, submitted
that O.M. dated 3.2.2000 should be made
applicable to officers who have retired
even prior to 1.1.96.”

WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 14 of 23

17.The aforesaid contention of the appellant in the said case
did not jell with the Court. The Court drew the distinction
between

those

who

were

invalidated

from

service

prematurely and others, like the appellant therein who were
allowed to complete normal tenure of service and held that
these two were distinct and separate categories. Therefore,
there was no violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. Exact
discussion in this behalf may be reproduced at this stage:“7. We do not find any merit in the above
arguments. As stated above, appellant
stood superannuated from the Indian Army
on 30.11.89.
He was entitled to war
disability pension.
He has been paid
arrears on that basis on and from 30.11.89.
Under Government of India letter No.
PC1(2)/97/D(Pen-C) dated 16.5.2001 the
rate of war injury element for hundred per
cent disability in battle casualty cases has
been prescribed. It is in accordance with
the rates mentioned in para 11.2 of the
letter of Government of India No. 1(2)/97/D
(Pen-C) dated 31.1.2001.
Under O.M.
dated 3.2.2000 the benefit of enhancement
of percentage of disability, and not the
rates, is given to officers who were in
service
on
or
after
1.1.96.
This
enhancement is from 30% to 50%.
Appellant claims this enhancement from
30% to 50% in his case also. However,
O.M. Dated 3.2.2000 states that the said
enhancement shall be applicable only to
those officers who stood invalidated out of
service. This provision is not applicable to
the
appellant
who
retired
on
superannuation prior to 1.1.96. Appellant
was not invalidated out of service. He
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 15 of 23

completed his normal tenure of service.
The benefit of enhancement is given to
those officers who stood invalidated out of
service because their tenure of service got
cut due to invalidment on account of
disability or war injury. Therefore, the
appellant does not fall in the category of
invalidment. The Government is always
entitled to classify officers who stood
retired vis-a-vis the officers whose tenure
of service got reduced due to invalidment.
These are two distinct and separate
categories. Hence, there is no violation of
Article 14 of the Constitution”

18.It would also be of interest to note that when the
appellant's

disability

pension

was

fixed

on

his

superannuation, while calculating the qualifying service, he
was given weightage of five years as per the relevant rules
and to protect his pension

he was given additional

weightage of three years. This three years weightage was
withdrawn after the revision of pension took place on the
basis of recommendation of the 5th Pay Commission.

The

appellant had challenged the withdrawal of the additional
weightage as well.

The Supreme Court repelled that

challenge as well on the ground that this protected
weightage of three points (in years) was removed after the
5th Pay Commission, as he started earning pension more
than that of a Major, which was not so during the period

WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 16 of 23

1989-99. For our purposes, second reason advanced by the
Supreme Court rejecting the contention of the appellant on
this score is relevant as the same deals with fixation of cut
off date. We, therefore, reproduce that portion:“Secondly, it is well settled in law that
Article 14 permits class legislation and not
classification
based
on
intelligible
differentia which distinguishes those that
are grouped together from others and that
differentia must have a rational relation to
the objects sought to be achieved by the
Act. In the case of Union of India vs.
P.N. Menon and others, this Court has
held that pay revision can invite a cut-off
date. In matters of pay fixation it is the pay
commission which is entitled to take into
account various parameters depending
upon the nature of posts, the duties
attached to those posts, the qualifications
attached thereto, the manner of calculating
the retirement benefits etc.”
19.This leads us to the judgment of the Supreme Court in P.N.
Menon (supra).

That was a case where the Third Pay

Commission had recommended that on price level rising
above the 12 monthly average of 272 (1960 = 100)
Government should review the position and decide whether
the dearness allowance scheme should be extended further
or the pay scales themselves should be revised.

On

30.9.1977 the price level reached that point. Therefore, the
Government

issued

O.M.

No.F-19(4)-E.V./79

WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

dated

Pg. 17 of 23

25.5.1977, which introduced a scheme to treat a portion of
the dearness allowance as pay in respect of government
servants, who retired on or after 30.9.1977. With reference
to different pay ranges, it fixed the amount of dearness pay
which was to be counted as emoluments for pension and
gratuity in terms of Rule 33 of the Central Civil Services
(Pension) Rules, 1972.

However, in the case of officers

drawing pay above Rs.2180 and retiring on or after
1.12.1978, the amount of dearness pay to be treated for the
purpose of retirement benefits, was specified in the O.M.
The O.M. enabled the persons who retired on or after
30.9.1977 but not later than 30.4.1979, to exercise an
option out of the two alternatives of getting pension and
death-cum-retirement

gratuity,

calculated

either

by

excluding the element of dearness pay or by including the
element of dearness pay. The question before the Supreme
Court was whether the said O.M. was discriminatory and
arbitrary so as to be violative of Article 14 of the
Constitution of India inasmuch as it was not applicable to all
the retirees irrespective of the dates of their retirement.
Answering the question in the negative and reversing the
decision of the High Court, the Supreme Court held:-

WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 18 of 23

20.“Whenever the Government or an authority,
which can be held to be a State within the
meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution,
frames a scheme for persons who have
superannuated from service, due to many
constraints, it is not always possible to extend
the same benefits to one and all, irrespective
of the dates of superannuation. As such any
revised scheme in respect of post-retirement
benefits if implemented with a cut-off date,
which can be held to be reasonable and
rational in the light of Article 14 of the
Constitution, need not be held to be invalid.
Whenever a revision takes place, a cut-off date
becomes imperative because the benefit has
to be allowed within the financial resources
available with the Government.”
21.The Supreme Court specifically considered the impact of
the judgment in D.S. Nakara (ibid), but held that dicta laid
down in that judgment would not be applicable in the said
case.

The distinguishing feature, as pointed out by the

Supreme Court, can be traced in para 20 of the judgment
and it would be wise on our part to reproduce the same:“20.
The scheme to merge a part of the
dearness allowance for purpose of fixing the
dearness pay, was evolved, and was linked
with the average cost of living index fixed at
272, which fell on 30-4-1977.
In this
background, it cannot be said that the date,
30-9-1977, was picked out in an arbitrary or
irrational manner, without proper application of
mind. The option given to employees, who
retired on or after 30-9-1977 but not later than
30-4-1979, to exercise an option to get their

dearness pay as indicated in the aforesaid
office memorandum or to get it included in
their
pension
and
death-cum-retirement
gratuity, was not an exercise to create a class
within class. The decision having a nexus with
the price index level at 272, which it reached
on 30-9-1977, was just and valid. It has been
rightly pointed out that respondents had never
been in receipt of dearness pay and as such
the office memorandum in question could not
have been applied to them. Similarly, the
encashment of leave was a new scheme
introduced which could not have been
extended retrospectively to respondents, who
had retired before the introduction of the said
scheme. Same can be said even in respect of
family pension scheme which was earlier
contributory, but with effect from 22-9-1977
the scheme was made non-contributory. The
respondent not being in service on the said
date, were not eligible for the said benefit and
no question of refunding the amount, which
had already been contributed by them did
arise. According to us, the High Court was in
error in applying the principles of D.S. Nakara1
in the facts and circumstances of the present
case.”
22.The subtle distinction which is, thus, made is that a new
benefit is introduced or a particular benefit already in
existence is revised in a manner that it is based on the
application of a new principle, there can be a cut off date
fixed for giving the said benefit prospectively from the said
date. The Court was of the opinion that any revised scheme
in respect of post retirement benefits, if implemented with a
cut off date, which can be held to be reasonable and rational

in the light of Article 14 of the Constitution, need not be held
to be invalid.
23.At this stage, it would be of use to take note of another
judgment of the Apex Court. The title of the case is State of
Punjab and Others Vs. Amar Nath Goyal and Others, (2005)
6 SCC 754. That was a case where O.M. dated 14.7.1995
issued by the Central Government whereby dearness
allowance linked to the All India Consumer Price Index
1201.66 (as on 1-7-1993) came up for consideration.

The

said benefit was made available to the employees who
retired or died on or after 1.4.1995, which was the cut off
date suggested by the 5th Pay Commission in its Interim
Report. The respondents had challenged fixation of cut off
date as they had retired before the said cut off date and
were, therefore, denied the benefit of the formula provided
in the O.M. dated 14.7.1995.

The High Court Punjab and

Harnaya had allowed the writ petitions and State of Punjab
and others had come in appeal.

The Supreme Court set

aside the judgment of the High Court and held that the cut
off date of 1.4.1995 was rightly fixed. What is important for
our purpose is to take note of the rationale given by the
Apex Court in the said judgment while upholding the said
cut off date.

The judgment premised on the ground that

WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 21 of 23

financial and economic implications are very relevant and
germane for any policy decision touching the administration
of the Government, at the centre or at the State level and
the cut off date of 1.4.1995 was fixed on a valid ground, i.e.
financial constraints.
24.When we apply the ratio of all the aforesaid judgments to
the facts of the present case, we are unable to accede to the
prayer of the petitioners in these writ petitions and there are
various reasons for that:
25.Firstly,

this

cut

off

date

of

1.1.1996

fixed

by

the

Government for granting the benefit in its orders dated
31.1.2001 has been upheld by the Supreme Court in the
case of P.K. Kapur (supra) albeit while discussing another
aspect. The reasons because of which the cut off date in the
same orders is upheld persuade us to take the same view in
the present case as well.
26.Secondly, as a consequence of the recommendation of the
5th Pay Commission, a new formula is prescribed in fixation
of disability pension.

It is not merely a revision of the

pay/pension. By introduction of such a formula for the first
time, the Government is entitled to fix a date from which it
would be enforced.
27.Thirdly, as pointed out in P.N. Menon (supra) and Amar
WP(C) Nos.5897-5900/06, 7159-623/04, 1839/06 and 1431/07

Pg. 22 of 23

Nath Goyal (supra), such pay revisions can invite cut off
date and such a date can be fixed having regard to various
parameters, one of which is financial constraints.

These

aspects are explained by the respondents in the counter
affidavit filed in the present case from which it is clear that
action cannot be treated as arbitrary.
28.We are, therefore, of the opinion that in this case also the
law laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of D.S.
Nakara (ibid) may not have any application and fixation of
cut off date of 1.1.1996 for the application of new formula,
given on the basis of the recommendations of the 5th Pay
Commission, cannot be treated as arbitrary or violative of
Article 14 of the Constitution. We, therefore, dismiss these
writ petitions.

However, there shall

be no orders as to

costs.
