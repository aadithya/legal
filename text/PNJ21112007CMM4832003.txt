PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)
Petitioner Chanchal got married to Himanshu son of

Satish Kumar on 9.12.1997. During summer vacations in courts
during 1998 her father-in-law, Satish Kumar, filed a suit for
mandatory and permanent injunction in which he impleaded his
son

Himanshu

and

the

petitioner

as

defendants

1

&

2

respectively. He stated in the plaint that his son was married to
the petitioner on 9.12.1997 and after marriage his son started
demanding a share in the property owned by him. He stated that
both i.e. his son and daughter-in-law were threatening to take
forcible possession of his business premises. He stated that he
page 1 of 5

had permitted his son and his daughter-in-law to live in room on
the first floor of property No. 2740, Gali Arya Samaj, Bazar Sita
Ram, Delhi.

A decree for mandatory injunction was prayed for

that the defendants should be directed to hand over possession of
the said room. A decree for permanent injunction was prayed for
to restrain his son and his daughter-in-law from interfering with
his business in 4 business premises detailed in prayer clause 'B' of
the plaint.
2.

Summons were issued in the suit returnable for

15.7.1998. On the very first day on which summons were made
returnable an application under Order 23 Rule 3 CPC was filed.
The same bore the signatures of the plaintiff, his son and his
daughter-in-law i.e. the petitioner. On same very day statements
of the plaintiff, his son and the petitioner were recorded in
support of the compromise application and the suit was disposed
of in terms of the compromise.
3.

In the application under Order 23 Rule 3 it was

mentioned that the defendants have been provided with separate
accommodation at property No. 11082, Gali No. 7, Subhash Park,
Shahdara where they have shifted.

It was stated in the

application that entire istridhan of the petitioner has been
received by her.

The suit was got disposed of in terms of the

compromise.

4.

On 3.10.1998 i.e. in less than 3 months the petitioner

filed an application praying that a fraud had been played upon
her.

That she had been coerced into signing the compromise

application and making a statement in the court and as recorded
on 15.7.1998. To bring home the point she pointed out that she
and her husband never shifted to a new residence. She explained
the circumstances under which she was made to sign the
compromise application. She pointed out that after her father in
law and her husband tricked her into the compromise and
obtained a decree they went to the house of her parents and
created a ruckus.

They resorted to violence.

A kalandra was

registered on 16.7.1998 evidencing the behaviour of her husband
and her father-in-law.
5.

Vide impugned order dated 28.3.2003 learned Trial

Judge has rejected the application holding that the remedy of the
petitioner was to file a separate suit.

That she could not seek

recall of the consent decree.
6.

I am afraid, the view taken by the learned Judge is

totally contrary to law. It is settled law that a fraud vitiates all
judicial proceedings. It is settled law that judicial proceedings are
rooted on the solemn affirmation and belief that parties have
bona fide litigated at the judicial forum.
7.

In fact, the only remedy to lay a challenge to a
page 3 of 5

compromise decree unlawfully obtained or which is void or
voidable is to move an application before the court concerned
which had passed the decree as held by the Supreme Court in the
decision reported as (1993) 1 SCC 581 Banwari Lal Vs. Chando
Devi.
8.

Before concluding I may note that after the stated

collusive decree was obtained, petitioner was thrown out of the
matrimonial house. Her husband and her father-in-law continue
to reside in the same house.
9.

Prima facie, a fraud has been played upon the young

bride.
10.

But since the matter has to be decided on merits by

the learned Trial Judge I speak no more.
11.

Petition stands disposed of quashing the impugned

order dated 28.3.2003.
12.

The application filed by the petitioner for setting aside

of the compromise decree is restored.
appear before

Parties are directed to

the learned Trial Judge on 10.12.2007. Learned

Trial Judge would put plaintiff and defendant No. 1 to notice and
thereafter decide the application filed by the petitioner for setting
aside of the compromise decree in accordance with law.
13.

Noting that the stated fraud took place in the year

1998 I direct learned Trial Judge to conduct day to day
page 4 of 5

proceedings and pronounce decision latest by 31.3.2008.
14.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti without payment

of any charges to learned counsel for the petitioner.
15.

No costs.
