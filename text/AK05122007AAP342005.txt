ANIL KUMAR, J.(Oral)

1.

This is an application by the petitioner for substitution of an

independent arbitrator in place of Mr.Justice O.P.Dwivedi (Retd) who
was appointed as an arbitrator by an order dated 12th May, 2006.

2.

The petitioner had filed an arbitration petition No.34/2005

under Section 11 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 where
this Court relying on Rite Approach Group Ltd Vs. Rosoboronexport,
2006(1) SCC 206 had appointed Mr.Justice O.P.Dwivedi (Retd) Judge

AA No.34/2005

as an arbitrator.

3.

Against the appointment of Mr.Justice O.P.Dwivedi (Retd) as an

arbitrator, the respondent had preferred a Special Leave Petition being
SLP No.11907/2006 before the Supreme Court which was dismissed
by order dated 31st July, 2006.

4.

The learned arbitrator, Mr.Justice O.P.Dwivedi (Retd) even after

dismissal of the special leave petition did not start the arbitration
proceedings and consequently a formal request was made by letter
dated 20th March, 2007 and thereafter a reminder dated 23rd May,
2007 was sent.

5.

Since Mr.Justice O.P.Dwivedi (Retd) was appointed as a

Chairman of MRTP Commission, therefore, by his letter dated 27th
July, 2007 he expressed his inability to act as an arbitrator due to his
present assignment.

6.

In the circumstances it is contended on behalf of petitioner that

a vacancy has occurred as contemplated under Section 15(a) of the
Act. The relevant Section 15 of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,
1996 is as under:“15. Termination of mandate and substitution of
arbitrator:- 1) In addition to the circumstances referred to
AA No.34/2005

Page 2 of 6

in Section 13 or Section 14, the mandate of an arbitrator
shall terminatea) where he withdraws from office for any reason; or
b) by or pursuant to agreement of the parties.
2) Where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a
substitute arbitrator shall be appointed according to the
rules that were applicable to the appointment of the
arbitrator being replaced.
3) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, where an
arbitrator is replaced under sub-Section (2), any hearings
previously held may be repeated at the discretion of the
arbitral tribunal.
4) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties, an order
or ruling of the arbitral tribunal made prior to the
replacement of an arbitrator under this section shall not
be invalid solely because there has been a change in the
composition of the arbitral tribunal.”

7.

Since a vacancy has arisen as the learned arbitrator appointed

by this Court has declined to act as an arbitrator on account of his
appointment as a Chairman of MRTP Commission, the petitioner has
become entitled for a substituted arbitrator in place of the arbitrator
Mr.Justice O.P.Dwivedi (Retd) appointed by order dated 12th May,
2006.

8.

The petitioner has filed this application under Section 151 of

the Code of Civil Procedure but after some arguments the learned
counsel for the petitioner states that the application be treated as a
petition under Section 15(2) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act. The
AA No.34/2005

Page 3 of 6

counsel for the respondent has no objection, in case the application is
treated as a petition under section 15(2) of the Arbitration and
Conciliation Act, 1996.

9.

The learned counsel for the petitioner has also relied on 2004(3)

Arb.L.R.483,

Jagdish

Prasad

Agarwal

Vs.Cimmco

Birla

Ltd;

M/s.Indian Compressors Ltd Vs.Govt of NCT of Delhi & Ors decided
on 20th September, 2007 in W.P(C) No.5546/2004 and 2004(1) R.A.J
464 (Cal.) Magma Leasing Ltd Vs. Tonganagaon Tea Co.Pvt Ltd to
contend that this application which has been filed under Section 151
of the Code of Civil Procedure can be treated as an application under
Section 15(2) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act, 1996 and a
substituted arbitrator can be appointed.

10.

In Jagdish Prasad Agarwal (Supra) a learned Single Judge has

proceeded on the premise that under Section 11 of the Arbitration
and Conciliation Act, 1996 the Court discharges its administrative
function and on the premise that even a notice to the opposite party
may not be necessary. In this matter it was held that the Court is not
bound in any manner whatsoever to exercise powers only under the
section invoked by an applicant. Instead it must fulfill the functions
expected of the Court by statute. It was further held that where a
vacancy has arisen which requires to be filled up under Section 11 of

AA No.34/2005

Page 4 of 6

the Act, a reference to Section 15 is irrelevant and on this view of the
matter, a substituted arbitrator was appointed. It will be worth noting
that the Supreme Court in the matter of S.B.P. Company Vs.Patel
Engineering Limited & Anr, AIR 2006 SC 450 had held that the power
exercised by the Chief Justice of the High Court of the Chief Justice of
India under Section 11(6) of the Act is not an administrative power
but it is a judicial power and the Court has the right to decide the
preliminary aspect which will be his own jurisdiction to entertain the
request, the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, the existence
or otherwise of a live claim and the existence of the condition for the
exercise of his power and also the qualification of the arbitrator or
arbitrators. In M/s Indian Compressors Ltd (Supra) an application
was filed under Section 15(a) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act,
1996 for appointment of a substituted arbitrator as Hon'ble
Mr.Justice O.P.Dwivedi (Retd) had declined to act as an arbitrator on
his being appointed as a Chairman of MRTP Commission and,
therefore, by order dated 20th September, 2007 a substituted
arbitrator was appointed in place of the said arbitrator.

11.

In Magma Leasing Ltd (Supra) a Single Judge of the Calcutta

High Court while dealing with an application under Section 11 of the
Act had appointed a substituted arbitrator under Section 15(2) of the
Arbitration & Conciliation Act as the named arbitrator had refused to

AA No.34/2005

Page 5 of 6

act.

12.

The application by the petitioner to appoint a substituted

arbitrator under Section 15(2) of the Arbitration & Conciliation Act
has not been contested by the respondent as no reply has been filed
and even the counsel for the respondent has not contested the
petition appointing a substituted arbitrator on refusal of Mr.Justice
O.P.Dwivedi (Retd) to act as an arbitrator.

13.

Considering the facts and circumstances, I appoint Shri S.M.

Chopra, Advocate, (Additional District Judge, Retd.),181, Deshbandhu
Apartment,

Kalkaji,

New

Delhi-110019

(Mob:9213230349,

2007 at 4.30 PM. Registry to send a copy of this order to the
