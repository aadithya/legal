“E” Delhi) (in short as 'Tribunal') has referred

the

following question under Section 256(1) of the Income
Tax Act, 1961 (in short as 'Act') for opinion of this
Court:“Whether on the facts and in the
circumstances of the case, the Income Tax
Appellate Tribunal erred in not holding that
the value of the properties as on 1st January,
1964 be taken by capitalisation method?”
2.

The brief facts of the present case are that the

Assessee who is an individual, acquired plot No.1 of
281 Sq.Yds and the well and another plot No.3 of 229
Sq. Yds.

containing an old house of 695 Sq.ft. in

partial partition of Sh.D.P.Aggarwal & Family (HUF)
during the assessment year 1978-79.

The said

properties appear to have been sold by the Assessee.
The Income Tax Officer scrutinised the computation of
capital gains filed by the Assessee.

The Assessee

claimed costs of acquisition of the property as on 1st
January, 1964 at Rs.26,780/- for plot No.1 and well and
at Rs.33,710/- for plot No.3 and the old house.

The

cost of acquisition was shown on the basis of the
valuation report of Sh.Dinesh Krishna, registered
valuer dated 30th March, 1979. It was noticed by the
Income Tax Officer that for the assessment year 197172, the same registered valuer has valued these very
properties along with others vide valuation report
dated 31st May, 1971. The land was valued at Rs.4 per
Sq.ft. and the old house also at Rs. 4 per Sq.ft. The
value in the case of HUF for assessment year 1971-72
declared on the basis of the said report of the
registered valuer was accepted by the Department.
Against this background, the Assessee was given an
opportunity to explain this discrepancy. However, no
explanation was given by the Assessee and under these
circumstances, the Income Tax Officer computed the
value of the property on 1st January, 1964 taking the
valuation report of the valuer dated 31st May, 1971. In
1971, the land was valued at Rs. 4 per Sq.ft. and the
old house was valued at Rs. 4 per Sq.ft. or Rs.36 per

Sq.Yd.

Taking into account the appreciation in the

value of the land from 1964 to 1971, the Income Tax
Officer took the value of amount as on 1st January,
1964 at Rs.20 per Sq.Yd. and the value of the old house
at Rs.36 per Sq.Yd as on 1st January, 1964. Thus the
capital gain was determined by the Income Tax officer
on the basis of the cost of acquisition.
3.

The Assessee contested the decision of the

Income Tax Officer before the Assistant Commissioner
of Income Tax. The Assistant Commissioner of Income
Tax agreeing with the reasoning of Income Tax Officer,
refused to interfere.
4.

Thereafter, the matter was brought before the

Tribunal by the Assessee and the Tribunal dismissed
the appeal filed by the Assessee and thus, this
reference has been made to this Court.
5.

In the present case, the same registered valuer

has valued the same properties twice, that is, first on
31st May, 1971 and subsequently on 30th March, 1979.

should be

However, the Assessee has not

given any reason as to how it can be done.
6.

With respect to these properties, the report of the

registered valuer dated 31st May, 1971 was utilised by
the Assessee and such utilisation was accepted by the
Revenue. Against this background, it is not clear as to
how for determining the costs of the property on 1st
January, 1964, the first report of the registered valuer
could not be relevant. No reason has been shown that
the earlier report should be ignored altogether.
7.

As per findings of the Tribunal, the Income Tax

Officer had worked out the cost of acquisition relying
upon the Assessee's own evidence.

There is no

evidence that the house property of plot No.3 was
being occupied by any tenant on rent. Further, as per
observation of the Tribunal,

certain pages regarding

rent are there in the paper book but the same were not

considered as the same were not placed before the
lower authorities.
8.

Under these circumstances, we have no hesitation

in holding that the Tribunal has not erred in holding
that the value of the properties as on 1st January, 1964
be taken by capitalisation method.
9.

Under

these

circumstances,

we

answer

the

question referred to us, in the negative, that is, in
favour of the Revenue and against the Assessee.
10. The reference is disposed of accordingly.
