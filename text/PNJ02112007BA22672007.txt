made by Pradeep

Kumar Garg who informed the police that he and his partners

PGR Overseas, a partnership firm of which the complainant was
a partner was in the business of import and export. In course
of business he met the petitioner in the first week of
March,2004 who introduced himself as a Director of M/s M/s

import of aluminium ingots

Negotiations were held for

from Nigeria.

After discussions

with the petitioner the deal was finalised. First consignment of
aluminium ingots weighing 49 tons were received.

Further

order for import of 300 tons of aluminium ingots was placed.
That M/s Don-Capco Afro Asia Limited informed the partnership
firm that under 12 invoices requisite goods were shipped from
Nigeria.

Save and except

2 invoices, it was informed that

goods pertaining to 10 invoices were handed over to the
shipper M/s CMA CGM. It was informed that the consignment
pertaining to 2 invoices was handed over to another shipper
M/s Specific International Lines (PTE) Ltd.

That based on the

bill of lading and other documents of export, payment in sum of
Rs.1.25 crores was released.

That when containers reached

ICD Tuglakabad and the complainant went to take delivery and
on delivery of some containers being taken it was revealed that
the containers were virtually empty.

One Manish Gupta is its Director and a Nigerian national
Akinlolu Sesan Akintunde is its Chairman.

50% of the share

holding is held by the petitioner and 25% each by Manish
Gupta and Akinlolu Sesan Akintunde.

Manish

Gupta

has

paid

Rs.25

lacs

to

the

complainant, approximating his 25% share in the company M/s
Don-Capco Afro Asia Limited.

On said account he had been

admitted to bail.
7.

Petitioner is in judicial custody since 8.7.2007 and

prays that he be released on bail.
8.

It was urged by learned counsel for the petitioner

that the offence, if any, has been committed in Nigeria and
since no sanction has been obtained from the Central
Government, same cannot be investigated by virtue of bar
under Section 188 Cr.P.C.

It was urged that no offence of

cheating has been made out.

It was urged that there is no

material to show that the petitioner was involved in the
offence. Counsel urged that clearance was obtained from the
authorities at Nigeria.

The goods passed out from the office of

the exporter at Nigeria to the shipping company. Who knows,
where and by whom the goods were removed.

In any case,

counsel urged that there was no positive material to indict

petitioner with the offence in question.
that the investigation is complete.
filed.

Lastly, it was urged

Charge-sheet has been

Trial is not likely to be completed in the near future.

That keeping in view the nature of offence,

to prepare the

defence petitioner should be set free.
9.

With respect to the submission that the offence of

cheating took place in Nigeria, suffice would it be to note that
the complainant parted with money when banker of the
complainant remitted money to the banker of the exporter.
The remission was in India.
10.

Section 182(1) of Cr.P.C. reads as under :-

11.

“182. Offences committed by letters, etc.(1) Any offence which includes cheating
may,if the deception is practised by means
of letters or telecommunication messages,
be inquired into or tried by any court within
local jurisdiction such letters or messages
were sent or were received;
and any
offence of cheating and dishonestly inducing
delivery of property may be inquired into or
tried by a court within whose local
jurisdiction the property was delivered by
the person deceived or was received by the
accused person.”
Thus, where property was delivered by the person

deceived would be the one of the many placed under the local
jurisdiction of which the offence could be tried.
12.

In

this

case,

money

was

remitted

by

the

Nigeria were received by the complainant.
the courts in India

Thus, prima facie,

would have jurisdiction to try the

complaint.
13.

On the issue that no offence being made out, suffice

would it be to note that payment of approximately Rs.1.25
crores was made on an inducement that requisite goods have
been discharged from a shipper from Nigeria. The containers
were found empty/nearly empty.

It cannot be said that the

offence of cheating is not prima facie made out.
14.

No doubt, a charge-sheet has been filed and the

petitioner would be in no position to influence the conduct of
investigation but noting the amount embezzled, in my opinion,
petitioner would not be entitled to be released at this stage in
view of the decision of the Supreme Court reported as JT 2000
(1) SC 541 Mahesh Kumar Bhawsinghka Vs. State of Delhi.
15.

Regarding involvement of the petitioner suffice

would it be to note that petitioner would be 50% beneficiary of
the ill-gotten wealth.
16.

The petition is dismissed.
