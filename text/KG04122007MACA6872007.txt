KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
*
By way of this appeal, the appellant seeks to challenge
the award dated 11.2.2004 as well as an order dated 30.5.2007
passed by the Tribunal, dismissing the application of the appellant
moved under Section 169/157 of the Motor Vehicles Act. There is
MAC. APP. No.687/2007

Page 1 of 5

a delay of 1273 days in filing the present appeal. For condoning
the delay, the contention of counsel for the appellant is that the
delay in filing the appeal has taken place primarily due to the time
consumed in prosecution of the application moved by the
appellant under Section 169 read with Sections 157, 174 and 175
of the Motor Vehicles Act in the execution petition filed by the
appellant seeking recovery of the award amount from respondent
Nos.4 and 5. Counsel for the appellant has thus sought to urge
that since respondent No.2 became owner of the offending vehicle
after purchase of the same, therefore, by fiction of law, the
liability to satisfy the award amount also rested on the respondent
No.2. Counsel thus contends that there is an apparent illegality in
the award as the Tribunal has not given the recovery rights to
recover the award amount from the owner of the offending
vehicle.
Counsel for the appellant has also invited my attention
to Para 17 of the award in which the Tribunal has held the
insurance company liable to pay the compensation amount on
behalf of respondent No.2 as well besides the other respondent
Nos.1, 4 and 5. The contention of counsel for the appellant is that
only in the operative para of the impugned award, the recovery
MAC. APP. No.687/2007

Page 2 of 5

rights to the appellant has not been given to recover the award
amount from respondent No.2 and the same has been restricted
only against respondent Nos.4 and 5.
I have heard learned counsel for the appellant at
considerable length.
The impugned award in the present case was passed
as long back as on 11.02.2004 and after passing of the award, the
appellant took its remedy of seeking recovery of the award
amount against respondent Nos.4 and 5.

In the said execution

application, the appellant has separately moved an application
under Section 169 read with Sections 157, 174 and 175 to recover
the award amount against respondent No.2 as well.

The said

application of the appellant was dismissed by the Tribunal vide
order dated 30.5.2007. I do not find any infirmity in order dated
30.5.2007 as the Tribunal has rightly held that the executing
Court cannot go behind the award to permit the appellant to
execute the award against respondent No.2 against whom the
directions for recovery were not given to the appellant.

The

appellant is seeking condonation of delay in preferring the present
appeal

on

the ground

that

the appellant

was

bonafidely

prosecuting its remedy to seek enforcement of recovery against
MAC. APP. No.687/2007

Page 3 of 5

respondent No.2 by way of filing the said application. Even if such
a plea of the appellant is accepted, still the appellant has failed to
prefer the appeal within the statutory period of limitation
prescribed under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act, i.e. within
a period of 90 days.

In Para 5 of the application seeking

condonation of delay the appellant itself has admitted that the
panel counsel had submitted his legal opinion on 26.7.2007
advising the appellant to prefer an appeal against the impugned
award dated 11.2.2004.

There is no explanation given by the

appellant in not filing the appeal even after submission of the said
legal opinion dated 26.7.2007.

It has only been stated that

thereafter the file was sent to the present counsel to file an
appeal and accordingly the same has been filed claiming
condonation of delay in the same. No explanation much less any
sufficient explanation has been given in the application as to why
even after submission of the legal opinion dated 26.7.2007, the
appeal could not be filed by the appellant till 3.11.2007.

The

original award in the present case was passed on 11.2.2004 and
the application of the appellant moved under Section 169 read
with Sections 157, 174 and 175 of the M.V. Act was dismissed
vide order dated 30.5.2007. Certified copy of the said order was
MAC. APP. No.687/2007

Page 4 of 5

applied on 6.6.2007 and the same was made available to counsel
for the appellant on 13.7.2007. The legal opinion was submitted
by counsel for the appellant on 26.7.2007. It is thus manifest that
the appellant has been totally careless in not filing the present
appeal even within 90 days period as mandated under Section
173 of the Motor Vehicles Act even if the same is counted from
the date of submission of the legal opinion dated 26.7.2007.
There is thus, apparent delay on the part of the appellant in filing
the present appeal.
I do not find any merit in the application seeking
condonation of delay in filing the present appeal after such a long
and unexplained delay.
Since the application moved by the appellant under
Section 169 read with Sections 157, 174 and 175 of the Motor
Vehicles Act has been dismissed, therefore, the present appeal
filed by the appellant cannot be entertained.
The same is accordingly dismissed.
