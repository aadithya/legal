Above captioned petitions arise out of the same

complaint and the same summoning order hence all the petitions
are being decided together.
2.

Respondent No.2, M/s.Sabby Builders & Promoters Pvt.

Ltd. filed a complaint under Section 138 read with Section 141
and 142 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 alleging that
M/s.Jhalani Tools (India) Ltd. (impleaded as accused No.1) had
instructed the complainant to render services of settling its dues
with banks and financial institutions.

That in lieu of services

rendered by it, a cheque in sum of Rs.7,30,50,000/- dated
24.5.2004 drawn on State Bank of India was issued in the name of
the complainant.

That when presented for encashment, the

cheque was returned dishonoured with the advice 'account
closed'. That in spite of calling upon the accused company to pay
the amount under the cheque none was paid.
3.

P.C.Jhalani,

Y.C.Jhalani,

Pradeep

Jhalani,

Sandeep

Jhalani, Anoop Jhalani and Ashok Jhalani were impleaded as
accused No.2 to 7 respectively.

In the memo of parties to the

complaint they were described as directors.

4.

Only allegations against the directors of accused No.1

are as averred in para 2 of the complaint. The same reads as
under:-

5.
dated

“2. That the accused No.1 is the Limited Company
and accused No.2 to 7 are the Managing Director
and Directors of the said accused No.1, therefore all
the accused persons are jointly and severally liable
to the acts and deeds of the accused No.1, all the
Managing Directors and directors are supervising
the affairs of the accused No.1 actively.”
After recording pre-summoning evidence, vide order
18.9.2004

learned

Metropolitan

Magistrate

issued

summons against all accused.

7.

complaint and the summoning order vide Crl.M.C. No.2894/2004.
His co-petitioner is the company, accused No.1.
8.

Anoop Jhalani, accused No.6 seeks quashing of the

complaint and the summoning order vide Crl.M.C. No.2737/2004.
9.

The company M/s.Jhalani Tools (India) Ltd., accused

No.1, P.C. Jhalani, accused No.2, Yogesh Jhalani, accused No.3
and Ashok Jhalani, accused No.7 have joined as co-petitioners in
Crl.M.C. No.2895/2004 while praying for quashing of the FIR and
the summoning order.
10.

I note that Yogesh Jhalani is a petitioner in 2 petitions.

11.

From the averments against the directors of the

company as averred in para 2 of the complaint, contents noted in

para 4 above, it is to be noted that the complainant has stated
that accused No.2 to 7 are the managing director and directors of
accused No.1.

In said para it is thereafter averred that all the

managing directors and directors are supervising the affairs of
accused No.1.
12.

It has not been stated as to who is the managing

director and who are the directors. Even in the pre-summoning
evidence led by means of an affidavit filed by Sanjay Sabharwal,
director of the complainant, accused No.2 to 7 are stated to be
the managing director and directors of accused No.1, without
specifying as to who is the managing director and who are the
directors.
13.

It could be urged (an argument not advanced as a

matter of fact) that since name of P.C. Jhalani was listed at serial
No.2 of the accused persons immediately after the name of the
company, reference to the managing director in the complaint has
to be a reference to P.C.Jhalani.
14.

But, it cannot be so, for the reason in the memo of

parties in the complaint P.C. Jhalani has been described as a
director of the company.
15.

It is settled law that unless law makes him liable an

individual is not vicariously liable for the act of another. Under
the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 the directors of a company
are made vicariously liable because of Section 141 of the

Negotiable Instruments Act 1881.
16.

A

managing

director

would

be vicariously

liable

because of the very nature of his office viz. as director managing
the company.
17.

As

held

in

the

decision

reported

as

SMS

Pharmaceuticals Ltd. vs. Neeta Bhalla & Anr. AIR 2005 SC 3512,
an actionable complaint under Section 138/141 of the Negotiable
Instruments Act 1881 against directors of a company must
contain the averments that the person described as the director
of the company was in charge and was responsible to the
company for the conduct of the business of the company at the
time when the offence was committed.
18.

In the latest decision on the issue pronounced by the

Supreme Court reported as JT 2007 (9) SC 449, K.Srikanth Singh
vs. M/s.North East Securities Ltd. it has been held that the
averments in the complaint must bring out as to on what basis it
is being alleged that the person concerned, as director of the
company, was responsible for the conduct of the business of the
company and was in charge of the affairs of the company.
19.

In the decision reported as AIR 1983 SC 67, MCD vs.

Ram Kishan Rohatgi, under noted averments in para 5 of the
complaint were a subject matter of consideration by the Supreme
Court:“5.
That the accused No.3 is the Manager of
accused No.2 and accused Nos.4 to 7 are the

20.

Directors of accused No.2 and as such they were in
charge of and responsible for the conduct of
business of accused No.2 at the time of sampling.”
In para 14 and 15, their Lordships of the Supreme

Court held as under:“14.
Reliance has been placed on the words
'as such' in order to argue that because the
complaint does not attribute any criminal
responsibility to accused Nos.4 to 7 except that
they were in charge of and responsible for the
conduct of the business of the company. It is true
that there is no clear averment of the fact that the
Directors were really in charge of the manufacture
and responsible for the conduct of business but the
words 'as such' indicate that the complainant has
merely presumed that the Directors of the company
must be guilty because they are holding a particular
officer. This argument found favour with the High
Court which quashed the proceedings against the
Directors as also against the Manager, respondent
No.1.
15.
So far as the Manager is concerned, we
are satisfied that from the very nature of his duties
it can be safely inferred that he would undoubtedly
be vicariously liable for the offence; vicarious
liability being an incident of an offence under the
Act. So far as the Directors are concerned, there is
not even a whisper nor a shred of evidence nor
anything to show, apart from the presumption
drawn by the complainant, that there is any act
committed by the Directors from which a
reasonable inference can be drawn that they could
also be vicariously liable. In these circumstances,
therefore, we find ourselves in complete agreement
with the argument of the High Court that no case
against the Directors (accused Nos.4 to 7) has been
made out ex facie on the allegations made in the
complaint and the proceedings against them were
rightly quashed.”
21.

It is apparent that with reference to the use of

expression 'as such' the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that it
amounted to a presumption drawn by the complainant and not a

positive statement that the concerned director was in charge of
and responsible for the conduct of the business of the company.
22.

In the instant case, use of the word 'therefore' in para

2 of the complaint reveals that the complainant sought to fasten
liability on the directors only on account of they being the
directors. To put it differently, the complaint is founded on the
basis that because certain persons are the directors of a company
therefore they are jointly and severally liable for the acts of the
company.
23.

On this short ground alone, the petitions filed by

accused No.2 to 7 have to succeed.
24.

As regards accused No.1, learned counsel for the

petitioners sought to urge that the complainant was not even
incorporated when the transaction between the accused No.1 and
the complainant was transacted.
25.

This issue would require evidence to be led. One fact

is not in dispute. The same is that accused No.1 had issued a
cheque in the name of the complainant company. Prima facie,
complainant

existed

when

the

transaction

was

transacted

between the 2 companies.

28.

No costs.
