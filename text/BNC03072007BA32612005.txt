1.
The petitioner is facing trial alongwith his 10
co-accused

in a case

FIR

under

PS

Parliament

relating

to

murder
Page 1 of 7

of

Smt.Phoolan Devi, a Member of Parliament (Lok
Sabha) which took place on 25th July, 2001 around
1.30 p.m.
2.

The petitioner, an Advocate by profession,
allegedly supplied a revolver and cartridges to the
prime accused Sher Singh Rana which were used in
commission of murder of Smt. Phoolan Devi.

This

apart, the petitioner is also alleged to have had
rendered advice to help his co-accused Sher Singh
Rana to create a false alibi.

The petitioner was

arrested on 2nd August, 2001 being a party to the
criminal conspiracy hatched to commit the murder
Smt. Phoolan Devi.
3.

Learned

senior counsel

for the petitioner

argued that in terms of prosecution case, the
petitioner had supplied a revolver and cartridges to
his co-accused Sher Singh Rana in the presence of
one Pankaj Kalra—PW-62.
Bail Application No. 3261/2005

Learned senior counsel
Page 2 of 7

contended that in his entire statement before the Trial
Court,

Pankaj

Kalra—PW

did

not

support

the

prosecution case in regard to alleged supply of the
revolver and cartridges to co-accused Sher Singh
Rana by the petitioner.

It was argued that co-

accused Sher Singh Rana initially did not name the
petitioner in his earlier two disclosure statements
recorded by the police and it was only in his third
disclosure statement that he is alleged to have had
told that a revolver and cartridges were supplied to
him by the petitioner. According to the learned senior
counsel, except Pankaj Kalra—PW, there is no other
evidence to support the prosecution case in regard to
alleged supply of revolver and cartridges to coaccused Sher Singh Rana by the petitioner.

It was

argued that the petitioner continues in custody ever
since the date of his arrest, i.e., 2nd August, 2001 and
as out of 172 prosecution witnesses, only 86 PWs

have been examined so far, it is unlikely that the trial
would be concluded in near future.

Learned senior

counsel argued that since the only

witness Pankaj

Kalra—PW, who could have deposed against the
petitioner, has already been examined, there is no
possibility of petitioner tampering with evidence in
case of his release on bail during the pendency of the
trial.
4.

The learned Additional Public Prosecutor, on
the other hand, in opposition to the bail plea,
submitted that though

Pankaj Kalra—PW did not

depose before the Court in conformity with his
statement under Section 161 CrPC and omitted to
state that the petitioner had supplied a revolver and
cartridges to his co-accused Sher Singh Rana in his
presence, it could not be lost sight of that in terms of
his own admission, Pankaj Kalra—PW happens to be
a close friend of main accused Sher Singh Rana and

thus it was not quite unexpected that he resiled from
his statement under Section 161 CrPC in regard to
the said fact.

On the count of delay in concluding

trial, it was pointed out that since one of the coaccused Shravan had been absconding and could be
arrested on 4th July, 2004 and later another coaccused Sher Singh Rana managed to escape from jail
custody on 17th February, 2004 and could be rearrested on 24th April, 2006 only, the progress of the
trial suffered a considerable setback.
5.

A Status Report, regarding progress of trial,
was called from the Trial Court which indicates that
out of 172 witnesses, statements of 86 prosecution
witnesses had been recorded by 15th May, 2007. It is
gathered that on a previous occasion while dismissing
the bail applications of co-accused, a direction was
issued to expedite the trial. It appears that inspite of
such direction, the trial has not yet reached half way

mark in terms of number of witnesses still left to be
examined.
6.

No doubt Pankaj Kalra—PW, solitary witness to
alleged supply of revolver and cartridges by the
petitioner to his co-accused Sher Singh Rana, made a
departure from his statement under Section 161 CrPC
while deposing before the Trial Court,

evidentiary

value of his statement is yet to be evaluated in
conjunction with other evidence, if any, brought forth
by the prosecution. The petitioner being alleged coconspirator the prosecution evidence to be produced
has to be looked at in its entirety to find the extent of
petitioner's complicity, if any, in the commission of
the crime. The release of the petitioner on bail in the
midst of trial when more than half the number of
prosecution witnesses are yet to be examined, may
put the trial in jeopardy as the petitioner may tend to
try to tamper with the evidence yet to be produced.

The bail plea of the petitioner thus cannot be granted.
7.

The
dismissed.

petition

is,

in

the

circumstances,

It is, however, impressed upon the Trial

Court to expedite conclusion of the trial on priority
basis.
