ORDER
20.03.2008
Petitioner’s husband was registered under New Pattern Registration

Scheme, 1979. At the time of registration, petitioner’s husband had given
his address as 12/9A, Tilak Nagar, New Delhi-110018. On 13th December,
1984, petitioner’s husband expired. Thereupon, the petitioner approached
DDA for transfer of registration in her name.

Petitioner has filed

correspondence between her and DDA during the period 1985 till 1989.
The correspondence shows that the petitioner had informed DDA about
death of her husband and also notified change of her address. DDA has
written letters to the petitioner at WZ-80, Sant Nagar, (Tilak Nagar), New

Delhi-110018. Thus, the new address of the petitioner was available with
the respondent-DDA.

The petitioner had also submitted several letters

along with affidavits, indemnity bond, etc. for transfer of mutation in her
name. In addition to these letters, the petitioner also sent another letter in
May, 1995 under registered post. Photocopy of the postal receipt issued
by the post office has been placed on record.
2.

It is the case of the petitioner that she was never intimated and

informed about allotment of any flat.
3.

DDA in their counter affidavit have stated that MIG flat No. 58,

Ground Floor, Jehangirpuri was allotted to the husband of the petitioner in
the computerized draw of lots held on 26th March, 1993.

Accordingly,

demand-cum-allotment letter was issued in the name of husband of the
petitioner i.e. Mr. S.R. Rawal on 27th August, 1993. The address on which
the said letter was issued is not stated by the DDA in their counter affidavit.
It is, however, stated that the said allotment letter was issued at the
address mentioned thereon but the same was returned back undelivered
with postal remarks ‘left without address’. Thereafter, on 14th July, 1997
cancellation letter was issued but the said letter was also returned back
with the same remarks. Photocopy of the said letter dated 14th July, 1997
has been enclosed by DDA as Annexure R-1. The said letter was issued in

the name of Mr. S.R. Rawal. Photocopy of the said letter shows that it was
issued at 12/9A. Tilak Nagar, New Delhi-110018.
4.

It is clear from the facts stated above that the petitioner had already

informed DDA in 1984-85 about death of her husband Mr. S.R. Rawal. She
had also informed DDA about change of address and the new address was
communicated to DDA.

DDA has also written letters during the period

1985 till 1989 at the new address. It is not understandable and defines
logic why DDA did not issue allotment letter at the new address in 1994.
Again in 1997, cancellation letter was issued at the wrong address. The
fault is entirely of DDA. From the counter affidavit, it appears that the
original file of the petitioner was lost and was not traceable and, therefore,
letters were sent to wrong address. This does not help DDA as they are
required to properly maintain their records. Petitioner cannot be penalized
for failure of DDA to properly maintain their records.

In these

circumstances, cancellation of registration is not justified and cannot be
sustained.

Petitioner is, therefore, entitled to allotment in terms of the

registration made by her husband way back in 1979. The petitioner will be
allotted a flat within a period of six weeks from today and will be charged
cost of the flat as per their policy. Respondent-DDA will be entitled to verify
genuineness of the claim made by the petitioner before issuing allotment

letter and for this purpose the petitioner will appear before Director
(Housing-II) on 16th April, 2008 at 3.30 p.m.

Petitioner will submit

documents and other particulars, which may be required.
The writ petition is accordingly disposed of.
