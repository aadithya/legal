The report has also been filed by Shri Dhan Raj, Regional

Director (Northern Region) by an affidavit, dated 18th February 2008.
Relying on Clause 10.1 of Part V of the Scheme of Amalgamation, it is
submitted that all the employees of the Demerged company shall
become the employees of the Resulting company without any break
or interruption in their services upon the sanctioning of the said
Scheme of Amalgamation.

The Regional Director further submitted that the individual

assets and liabilities pertaining to the BPO Undertaking of the
Demerged company proposed to be transferred to the Resulting
company was mentioned in the Scheme, but the values thereof have
not been mentioned in the Scheme as given in the Valuation Report.
However, it was conceded by the learned Dy. RoC that there is no
requirement in law that the individual valuation of the assets and
liabilities has to be contained in the proposed Scheme. Furthermore,
the learned advocate for the applicant pointed out that the Resulting
company in consideration of transfer of the demerged undertaking,
has agreed under the Scheme to allot 1,71,55,440 equity shares of
face value of Rs.10/- each as fully paid up of the resulting company to
the shareholders of the Demerged company in the ratio of 7095:1000
equity shares held by the shareholders of the Demerged company.
Thus the objection of the Regional Director does not subsist. No other
objection has been received against the Scheme as proposed.
