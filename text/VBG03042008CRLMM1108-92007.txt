Crl.M.C.No.1108/2007
2.

Brief facts of this case are that on the basis of specific

information, the officers of Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI)
intercepted the petitioner Ajay Gulati while he was entering security
lounge at departure hall of I.G.I. Airport, New Delhi on the night
intervening 11/12th August, 2002. He was scheduled to travel by
Flight No.TG-316 for Bangkok. As a result of detailed examination

Crl.M.C.Nos.1108 & 1109/2007

Page 2 of 11

of his bag as well as his personal search, 4,500 U.S. dollars were
recovered from the personal search of the petitioner while from his
baggage 15,000 (Traveler‟s Cheque) U.S. dollars were recovered.
3.

On enquiry, petitioner Ajay Gulati explained the recovery of

U.S.$ 4,500 from his personal possession as amount brought by him
on his arrival from Hong Kong on 2nd August, 2002.
4.

In the absence of any true and proper declaration and any true

legal acquisition/possession of U.S.$ 4,500, the adjudicating
authority ordered absolute confiscation thereon. During the course
of follow up action, his residence was searched on 12 th August, 2002
and some foreign currency was also recovered from his residence.
As petitioner Ajay Gulati could not produce any satisfactory
documentary evidence or otherwise for legal acquisition/possession
of the foreign currency, the same was ordered to be absolutely
confiscated.
5.

The adjudicating authority imposed a penalty of Rs.10 lacs on

the petitioner Ajay Gulati.
6.

Aggrieved by the order of the adjudicating authority, appeal

was filed by the petitioner Ajay Gulati before Commissioner of

Crl.M.C.Nos.1108 & 1109/2007

Page 3 of 11

Customs (Appeals). However, the appeal filed by the petitioner
Ajay Gulati was dismissed.
7.

Thereafter, petitioner Ajay Gulati filed a revision petition

under Section 35 EE of the Central Excise Act, 1944. Vide impugned
order dated 30th January, 2006, the order of adjudicating authority
dated 30th May, 2005 was set aside and penalty imposed on the
Petitioner Ajay Gulati was set aside.
Crl.M.C. No.1109/2008
8.

Both petitioners Kapil Rai and Jatin Kapoor were similarly

intercepted by officers of DRI on the night intervening 11/12th
August, 2002 at I.G.I Airport while they were scheduled to travel to
Bangkok. As a result of detailed examination of their bags as well as
personal search US$ 2,000 and 27,000 US$ (Traveler‟s cheque) each
were recovered from their possession. In the absence of any true
and proper declaration and any legal acquisition/possession of the
Traveler‟s cheque and US Dollars recovered from the petitioners
Kapil Rai and Jatin Kapoor, the adjudicating authority ordered
absolute confiscation of the same.

The adjudicating authority

imposed a penalty of Rs.5 lacs each upon both the petitioners.
Aggrieved by the order of adjudicating authority, appeals were filed

Crl.M.C.Nos.1108 & 1109/2007

Page 4 of 11

by the petitioner Kapil Rai and Jatin Kapoor before Commissioner of
Customs (Appeals).

However, their appeals were dismissed.

Thereafter, both the petitioners filed revision petition under Section
35EE of the Central Excise Act, 1944. Vide impugned order dated
30th January, 2006, the orders of adjudicating authority dated 31st
May, 2005 was set aside and penalty imposed upon both the
Petitioners namely Kapil Rai and Jatin Kapoor was set aside.
9.

It has been contended by learned counsel for the petitioners

that these petitioners have been absolved by the impugned order
passed by Joint Secretary (Revisionary Authority) Government of
India, whereby a categorical finding of facts have been recorded that
petitioners have not contravened any provision of Customs Act and
the same were in consonance of the provision of the Customs Act
and had thereby absolved them of their liability towards the
personal penalties imposed on them by the lower authorities.
Further, the order passed by the Joint Secretary absolving the
Petitioners has been accepted by the Government under the
communication dated 21st September, 2006 whereby it has been
candidly accepted that the order passed by the Joint Secretary is
acceptable and consequently the penalties which were deposited as

Crl.M.C.Nos.1108 & 1109/2007

Page 5 of 11

a condition of hearing the appeal were ordered to be refunded in
favour of the petitioners. It is further contended that besides the
adjudication proceedings, independent criminal prosecution has
been initiated under Section 135(1)(a) of the Customs Act, 1962 for
the same set of allegations.

The Apex Court and this Court in

various judgments have taken the view that although both the
proceedings are initiated independently but the finding of facts
recorded in adjudication proceedings shall have the direct bearing
on the criminal prosecution and in case the petitioners have been
discharged and absolved under the adjudication proceedings on
merits, no purpose would be served by continuing the criminal
prosecution on the same set of allegations. The reason being, if on
the same evidence, a lower standard of proof required in
adjudication proceedings has not been achieved, higher standard of
proof required in a criminal trial would be incapable of being
achieved.
10.

Learned counsel for the petitioners in support of his

contentions has cited following judgments:Bhavnesh Kumar vs. Union of India & Ors., Crl.M (M)
2139/91 decided on 31.7.1992, G.L. Didwania vs. Income Tax Officer

11.

On the other hand, it has been argued by learned counsel for

the respondent that wherever offences are separately and
independently prescribed in special legislation, it is open to
authorities to proceed independently, irrespective of adjudication
order and in support of its case, learned counsel for the respondent
has cited following various judgments:Standard Chartered Bank & Ors. vs. Directorate of
Enforcement & Ors. 11 (2006) BC 391 (SC), Commissioner of Income
Tax, Mumbai vs. Bhupen Chambak Lal Dalas & Anr. Etc., 2001 II
AD (SC) 545, P. Jayappan vs. S.K. Perumal AIR 1984 SC 1693,

(SC), Santram Paper Mills vs. Collector of Central Excise, 1997 (96)

Magistrate, Crl.830/2001 decided on 13.2.2002, N. Neelakanta Rao
vs. State of Andhra Pradesh 2000 (122) ELT 7 (A.P.).
12.

A somewhat similar question arose in recent case decided by

this Court in Crl.M.C.No.938/05, M/s. Bihariji Mfg. Co. P. Ltd. vs.
Commissioner of Central Excise (supra).
13.

In that case, the allegations against the petitioners were that

they indulged in clandestine removal of manufactured goods
exceeding rupees one crore and the petitioners were liable to pay
excise duty.

The adjudicating order was passed against the

petitioners by Commissioner of Central Excise. Aggrieved against
that order they preferred appeals to the Customs, Excise and Service
Tax Appellate Tribunal and the Tribunal allowed the appeals and
held inter-alia that no materials were produced nor was there
anything brought on record to show that the goods were actually
cleared by the petitioners. On the basis of findings and order of the
Tribunal (which it is stated, has become final), the petitioners‟

Crl.M.C.Nos.1108 & 1109/2007

Page 8 of 11

claimed that it was not open for respondent to proceed with the
criminal complaint any longer.
14.

This Court after taking note of various decisions of Apex

Court held that principles which can be culled out from the various
judgments, when all the judgments are read out harmoniously,
would be following:“1.
On the same violation alleged against a person, if
adjudication proceedings as well as criminal
proceedings are permissible, both can be initiated
simultaneously. For initiating criminal proceedings on
does not have to wait for the outcome of the
adjudication proceedings as the two proceedings are
independent in nature.
2.
The findings in the departmental proceedings
would not amount to resjudicata and initiation of
criminal proceedings in these circumstances can be
treated as double jeopardy as they are not in the nature
of Prosecution.
3.
In case adjudication proceedings are decided
against a person who is facing prosecution as well and
the Tribunal has also upheld the findings of the
adjudicators/assessing authority, that would have no
bearing on the criminal proceedings and the criminal
proceedings are to be determined on its own merits in
accordance with law, uninhibited by the findings of the
Tribunal. It is because of the reason that in so far as
criminal action is concerned, it has to be proved as per
the strict standards fixed for criminal cases before the
criminal court by producing necessary evidence.
4.
In case of converse situation namely where the
accused persons are exonerated by the competent
Crl.M.C.Nos.1108 & 1109/2007

Page 9 of 11

authorities/Tribunal in adjudication proceedings, one
will have to see that reasons for such exoneration to
determine whether these criminal proceedings could
still continue. If the exoneration in departmental
adjudication is on technical ground or by giving benefit
of doubt and not on merits or the adjudication
proceedings were on different facts, it would have no
bearing on criminal proceedings. If, on the other hand,
the exoneration in the adjudication proceedings is on
merits and it is found that allegations are not
substantiated at all and the concerned persons(s) is/are
innocent, and the criminal prosecution is also on the
same set of facts and circumstances, the criminal
prosecution cannot be allowed to continue. The reason
is obvious; criminal complaint is filed by the
departmental
authorities
alleging
violation/
contravention of the provisions of the Act on the part of
the accused persons. However, if the departmental
authorities themselves, in adjudication proceedings,
record a categorical and unambiguous finding that
there is no such contravention of the provisions of the
Act, it would be unjust for such departmental
authorities to continue with the criminal complaint and
say that there is sufficient evidence to foist the accused
persons with criminal liability when it is stated in the
departmental proceedings that ex-facie there is no such
violation. The yardstick would, therefore, be to see as
to whether charges in the departmental proceedings as
well as criminal complaint are identical and the
exoneration of the concerned person in the
departmental proceedings is on merits holding that
there is no contravention of the provisions of any Act.
5.
The above narrative would show that show cause
notice as well as the complaint are premised on
identical facts, namely, clandestine and illegal removal
without disclosure to the Central Excise Authorities by
the petitioners. Though the first round went in favour
of the Department in as much as adjudication by the
Commissioner fastened liability upon the petitioners,
Crl.M.C.Nos.1108 & 1109/2007

Page 10 of 11

15.

those findings were reversed by the Tribunal, which
categorically and unambiguously recorded that there
were no materials recovered to prove the charge of
clandestine removal, or that evasion of duty stood
established. In these circumstances, I am of the opinion
that on application of the rule enunciated in Sunil
Gulati‟s case, (particularly, the latter portion of
proposition (4) quoted above, i.e. exoneration of the
assessee being on merits, and not on a technicality)
further proceedings in the criminal complaint would
not sub-serve ends of justice.”
Similarly, when the highest Appellate Authority in the present

case has also absolved these petitioners on merits, no useful purpose
will served by continuing the criminal proceedings on the same set
of allegations.
16.

Various judgments cited by learned counsel for respondent, in

the facts and circumstances of the present case are not applicable.
17.

Accordingly, both the petitions are allowed and the criminal

complaint case no.995/1 dated 10th January, 2002 titled as DRI vs.
Ajay Gulati and Ors. pending in the Court of ACMM, Patiala House,
New Delhi, qua the present petitioners namely Ajay Gulati, Kapil
Rai and Jatin Kapoor is hereby quashed.
18.

Copy of this order be sent to the Trial Court.
