PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.(Oral)

1.

By placing reliance upon two decisions of the

Hon'ble Supreme Court, learned counsel for the appellant
managed to secure a notice to show cause from this court.

page 1 of 7

The decisions relied upon were AIR 2006 SC 1926 New India
Assurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Harshadbhai Amrutbhai Modhiya & Anr.
and 2006 (5) SCC 200 P.J.Narayanan Vs. UOI & Ors.
2.

In the instant matters it is not in dispute that the

appellant had issued a policy of insurance. It is not in dispute
that the workman of the employer who was the insured under
the policy had died/suffered 100% disability during course of
employment and relatable to duties.
3.

The only grievance urged in the appeal is to the

liability fastened on the appellant to pay interest on the
compensation assessed.
4.

The appellant, bound by the terms of the policy of

insurance, has acquiesced in the obligation to pay the
compensation assessed to the dependents of the deceased
workman who are respondents in FAO No.22/2008 as also to
pay compensation to the workman who suffered 100%
disability being the respondent in FAO No.21/2008.
5.

The decisions relied upon by the appellant do not

help the appellant at all.

In Harshadbhai Amrutbhai's case,

their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that where
the policy of insurance specifically includes a clause excluding
liability to pay interest on the compensation assessed, only
then would the insurance company be not liable to pay interest
FAO 21/08

page 2 of 7

on the compensation assessed.
6.

In P.J.Narayanan's case a writ petition was filed

seeking a direction against the insurance company to delete
the clause in the insurance policy which provided that in case
of

compensation

to

be

paid

under

the

Workmen's

Compensation Act the insurance company will not be liable to
pay interest.

Their Lordships of the Hon'ble Supreme Court

held that in the absence of a statutory liability compelling the
insurance company to pay interest on the compensation
assessed it would not be permissible for the court to issue a
mandamus as prayed for.
7.

The controversy pertaining to payment of issue of

interest needs to be settled with reference to the language of
Section 4A of the Workmen's Compensation Act 1923 which
reads as under:“4A. Compensation to be paid when due and
penalty for default.-(1) Compensation under Section
4 shall be paid as soon as it falls due.
(2) In cases where the employer does not accept the
liability for compensation to the extent claimed, he
shall be bound to make provisional payment based on
the extent of liability which he accepts, and, such
payment shall be deposited with the Commissioner or
made to the workman, as the case may be, without
prejudice to the right of the workman to make any
further claim.
(3) where any employer is in default in paying the
compensation due under this Act within one month
FAO 21/08

page 3 of 7

from the date it fell due, the Commissioner shall(a) direct that the employer shall, in addition to
the amount of the arrears, pay simple interest
thereon at the rate of twelve per cent per annum
or at such higher rate not exceeding the
maximum of the lending rates of any scheduled
bank as may be specified by the Central
Government, by notification in the Official
Gazette, on the amount due; and
(b) if, in his opinion, there is no justification for
the delay, direct that the employer shall, in
addition to the amount of the arrears and
interest thereon, pay a further sum not
exceeding fifty per cent of such amount by way
of penalty:
PROVIDED that an order for the payment of penalty
shall not be passed under Clause (b) without giving a
reasonable opportunity to the employer to show cause
why it should not be passed.
Explanation.--For the purposes of this sub-section,
"scheduled bank" means a bank for the time being
included in the Second Schedule to the Reserve Bank
of India Act, 1934 (2 of 1934).
(3A) The interest and the penalty payable under subsection (3) shall be paid to the workman or his
dependant, as the case may be.”
8.

In the decision reported as Ved Prakash Garg Vs.

Premi Devi & Ors. 1998 (1) ACJ 1, a question arose before the
Hon'ble Supreme

Court whether the phrase “liability arising

under the Workmen's Compensation Act” as used in the
proviso to Sub Section of Section 147 of the Motor Vehicles Act
1988 and as found in the proviso to clause (i) of Sub Section (I)
of Section (II) of the insurance policy would cover only the

FAO 21/08

page 4 of 7

principal amount of compensation as computed by the
Commissioner Workmen's Compensation or whether it would
include liability to pay interest and penalty as imposed on the
insured

employer

under

contingencies

contemplated

by

Section 43A (3)(a) and (b) of the Workmen's Compensation
Act.
9.

After

examining

the

entire

scheme

of

the

Workmen's Compensation Act, the Hon'ble Supreme Court held
that:A.

Payment of interest and penalty are two distinct

liabilities arising under the Workmen's Compensation Act.
B.

Penalty is not a part and parcel of the legal liability

of the employer to compensate his employee and since the
insurer is under a contractual obligation to indemnify the
employer for his legal liability the insurer is not liable to pay
the penalty.
C.

Liability to pay interest is part and parcel of legal

liability of the employer to pay compensation upon penalty of
payment of that amount within one month. Therefore, claim
for compensation payable under the Workmen's Compensation
Act along with interest thereon will have to be made good by
the insurance company, jointly with the insured employer.

In Ved Prakash Garg's case the Hon'ble Supreme
page 5 of 7

Court noted the decision of the Karnataka High Court reported
as Oriental Insurance Co. Ltd. Vs. Raju 1994 ACJ 191 wherein a
Division Bench after noting the expressed terms of the
insurance policy took the view that the policy did not extend to
indemnify the insured in respect of interest and/or penalty
which may be imposed on the insured on account of his failure
to

comply

with

Compensation Act.

the

requirements

of

the

Workmen's

The Hon'ble Supreme Court noted that

where there was an express exclusion clause qua the liability
of interest under the insurance policy, as was found by the
Division Bench of the Karnataka High Court, liability arising
under Section 4A of the Workmen's Compensation Act to pay
interest on the principal amount need not be met by the
insurance company.
11.

A focus analysis of the decision of the Hon'ble

Supreme Court in Ved Prakash Garg's case makes it clear that
the Hon'ble Supreme Court had made a distinction in a policy
where no clause excluding liability of the insurance company to
pay interest exists and a policy where a specific clause
excluding liability to pay interest exists.
12.

In the instant cases it is not the case of the

appellant that the policy of insurance contained a covenant
excluding liability to pay interest on the principal sum found
FAO 21/08

page 6 of 7

payable as compensation.
13.

Thus, I find no merits in the appeals.

14.

The appeals are dismissed.

15.

No costs.
