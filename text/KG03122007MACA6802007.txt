KAILASH GAMBHIR, J.(Oral):
Respondent no.1 is the driver of the offending
vehicle. Since the main contestant is insurance company,
MAC APP No. 680/2007

page 1 of 6

therefore, notice on the respondent no.1 is dispensed
with.
The present appeal has been filed by the
appellant seeking modification of the impugned award
only to the extent of setting aside the finding of the
tribunal taking into consideration 2/3rd income of the
deceased towards

the personal expenses after his

marriage.
The present appeal can be disposed of at this
stage itself, since a short controversy is involved in the
matter.
Admit.
Counsel for the appellant contends that under
the Second Schedule of the Motor Vehicles Act the
personal expenses from the income of the deceased has
to be reduced to 1/3 rd. Counsel further contends that the
finding of the

Tribunal deducting 2/3rd

of the income

towards personal expenses after the purported marriage

page 2 of 6

of the deceased is in blatant violation of the mandate of
the statute.
Mr. Gaur, counsel for the respondent on the
other hand refutes such submissions of the counsel for
the appellant.

Mr. Gaur contends that already the

Tribunal has assessed the income of the deceased on the
basis

of the minimum wages although the appellants

have failed to prove on record any income of the
deceased.

Counsel

also

contends

that

in

such

circumstances under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles
Act, the notional income of the deceased at Rs.15,000/per annum should have been taken into consideration.
Counsel further contends that there is no infirmity in the
impugned award so far as the deduction of 2/3rd income
towards personal expenses is concerned

as after the

marriage, personal expenses are bound to increase.
Counsel for the respondent further contends that at best
50% of the income could be deducted towards personal

expenses in view of the various pronouncements of the
Apex Court in such matters.
I have heard counsel for the parties.
Perusal of the award shows that the deceased
was a young boy of 19 years of age

who died in the

accident. The claim petition

Section 163-A of

invoking

the Motor Vehicles Act was filed by the appellants. It is
correct that the appellants did not file any document to
prove

that

was

of

However, in any event of the

matter, the appellants did prove the fact that

the

deceased was doing welding work prior to the date of the
accident.

In such circumstances only the Tribunal had

taken resort to the Minimum Wages Act for assessing the
income of the deceased, which otherwise falls below
Rs.40,000/- per annum. Therefore, the Second Schedule
of the Motor Vehicle Act is applicable in such a case. The
contention of the counsel for the respondent is therefore,

rejected. As regards the contention of the counsel for the
respondent that the Tribunal has rightly taken into
consideration 2/3rd income towards personal expenses or
at best the deduction could have been 50% towards
personal expenses after his marriage, I find the same to
be devoid of any merit as the claim petition was filed by
the appellants under Section 163-A of the Motor Vehicles
Act in which it is clearly stated that the personal
expenses shall be reduced only by 1/3rd from the income
of the deceased. Therefore, the impugned award to that
limited extent is set aside. The expenses of the deceased
for the entire multiplier shall be taken to be 1/3rd instead
of 2/3rd for a period of six years.
In the light of the above discussion, the total
award amount of Rs.3,53,000/- shall be payable
