who is also associated in one or the other manner in
various companies formed by accused No.1 and had

15. That the accused No.5 deliberately and
dishonestly permitted to open a bogus Account of
M/s. Zed Investment in the Bank without taking
photographs and in the presence of accused persons
at the time of opening the said bank Account.”
It is apparent that case of the respondent, in a

nutshell, is that he had innocently signed the papers relating to
the company Zed Investment Ltd. and that Tarun Goel and his
wife Vandana Goel (the petitioners) were the ones who induced
him into so doing.
6.

In

the

charge

sheet

submitted

by

the

CBI,

respondent has been shown as the main accused and it has
been alleged that during the period June 1996 to April 1997, he
along with other co-accused entered into a criminal conspiracy
with object to cheat the general public by collecting money
through issues of shares. As per charge sheet, the respondent

Crl.M.C.1713/2004

page 5 of 7

is alleged to have executed all the documents including
operating the bank account of the company.

The money

collected has to be accounted for.
7.

It is thus apparent that the respondent is projecting

his defence by and under the complaint.
8.

The complaint filed by the respondent has a direct

nexus with the CBI case. It cannot be taken cognizance of.
9.

Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973

reads as under:“319.
Power to proceed against other
persons appearing to be guilty of offence.(1) Where, in the course of any inquiry into, or trial
of, an offence, it appears from the evidence that
any person not being the accused has committed
any offence for which such person could be tried
together with the accused, the Court may proceed
against such person for the offence which he
appears to have committed.
(2) Where such person is not attending the
Court he may be arrested or summoned, as the
circumstances of the case may require, for the
purpose aforesaid.
(3) Any person attending the Court although
under arrest or upon a summons, may
detained by such Court for the purpose of
inquiry into, or trial of, the offence which
appears to have committed.

(b) subject to the provisions of clause (a), the
case may proceed as if such person had been an
accused person when the Court took cognizance
of the offence upon which the inquiry or trial was
commenced.”
Thus, at the trial in the CBI case if evidence surfaces

against a person not being the accused, the learned trial judge
can always proceed against said person.
11.

The petition is allowed. The summoning order dated

22.8.2001 and the complaint case No. 10/2000 filed by the
respondent is quashed.
