Through Mr.C.Mohan Rao, for Ms.Sangeeta Chandra,

CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA
ORDER

1. The petitioner had submitted highest tender and was allotted shop bearing
No.S-21, CSC 13, Sector 16, Rohini vide demand letter dated 6th
December, 2002. The area of the shop as mentioned in the demand cum
allotment letter was 17.280 sq. yards.
2. It is the case of the petitioner that in June, 2000, he visited the said shop
and found that there was a courtyard adjacent to the shop measuring 9.97
sq. mtrs.

The case made out by the petitioner is that he made repeated

representations to DDA to clarify whether he was being asked to pay for
the courtyard, but there was no response from DDA and therefore, he has
been compelled to approach this Court by way of the present writ petition,
which was filed in the year 2006.
3. I may note here that the respondent/DDA in their affidavit has pointed out
that after allotment letter dated 6/12.5.2000 was issued , the petitioner had

written letter dated 30.8.2000 asking for extension of time by 30 days to
make payment. This time was granted by DDA. In this letter there is no
mention about courtyard and whether or not the petitioner has been asked
to pay for the same. The petitioner did not make payment of Rs.2,31,085/in terms of demand cum allotment letter and by order dated 14.8.2001,
allotment of the shop in favour of the petitioner was cancelled. It may be
noted here that the demand cum allotment letter dated 6/5.12.2000
specifically stipulated that payment was to be made within 30 days of the
issue of the said letter.

Under the heading Payment Terms, it was

stipulated :
“Payment Terms:
Please note that in case the payment is not
received within the stipulated period i.e. on or
before the due date, the allotment shall
automatically stand cancelled and the amount
of earnest money deposited by you shall stand
forfeited without any notice.”
4. Thus the petitioner was always aware that in case he does not make
payment within stipulated period, i.e. before the due date, allotment shall
stand cancelled and the earnest money deposited shall be forfeited. It is
apparent that allegation and story of courtyard is an after thought and was
raised by the petitioner for the first time only in 2002, nearly one year after
cancellation of the allotment was made by letter dated 14.8.2001.
Allotment was made in 2000.
5. The present writ petition has been filed in the year 2006. The petition is

also bad for laches and delay, as it seeks to enforce allotment vide letter
dated 06/12.5.2000, which was cancelled on 14.8.2001.
6. Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is ready and
willing to pay current costs for the shop. It is not possible to accept the
said prayer of the petitioner. The shop will have to be put for auction or
tender in terms of Nazul Rules. The petitioner does not have any vested
right to seek allotment of the said shop which was cancelled way back in
14.8.2001. There has been substantial increase in market prices between
2000 and 2006.
7. The writ petition is dismissed.
