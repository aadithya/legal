ORDER
These appeals under Section 260(A) of the Income Tax Act, 1961

('Act') are directed against the common order dated 30th November, 2005
passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal ('Tribunal') Delhi Bench “A”,
New Delhi in ITA No. 3673 and 3674/Del/01 for the Assessment Years
1995-96 and 1996-97 respectively.
2.

By the impugned order, the Tribunal dismissed the appeals filed by

the Revenue questioning the order dated 21st June, 2001 passed by the
ITA Nos 1074 & 935/2006

page no 1 of 4

Commissioner of Income Tax ['CIT(A)'] deleting the penalty levied on the
Assessee by the Assessing Officer under Section 271 (1)(c) of the Act for
the assessment years in question.
3.

The Tribunal has dismissed the appeals on two grounds. The first is

that the assessment order indicates no satisfaction by the Assessing Officer
that the penalty proceedings should be initiated against the Assessee.
Following the judgment of this Court in Commissioner of Income Tax v.
Ram Commercial Enterprises Limited [2000] 246 ITR 568 which has been
since approved by the Supreme Court in Dilip N. Shroff v. Joint
Commissioner of Income Tax [2007] 291 ITR 519 (SC) and T.Ashok Pai
v. Commissioner of Income Tax [2007] 292 ITR 11 (SC), the Tribunal held
against the Revenue on this ground and upheld the order of the CIT(A).
4.

The Tribunal considered the case on merits and found that for both

the assessment years, the Assessing Officer had disallowed certain claims
and made certain additions. It found that the Revenue had been unable to
demonstrate that the Assessee had concealed any income or furnished
inaccurate particulars of income.

Accordingly, even on merits,

the

Tribunal held against the Revenue and dismissed both the appeals.
5.

Learned senior standing counsel for the Revenue urges an alternative

submission that the satisfaction of the Assessing Officer for initiation of
penalty proceedings can be discerned from the Assessment Order itself and
that this question is pending consideration before the Larger Bench of this
Court in Commissioner of Income Tax, Delhi-IV v. Indus Valley
Promoters Limited. The substantial question of law that has been referred
to the larger Bench of this Court in the said case reported in [2006] 155
Taxman 223 reads as under:

ITA Nos 1074 & 935/2006

page no 2 of 4

“Whether satisfaction of the Officer initiating the
proceedings under Section 271 of the Income Tax
Act can be said to have been recorded even in
cases where satisfaction is not recorded in
specific terms but is otherwise discernible from
order passed by the authority?
6.

She accordingly urged that this Court should await the decision of the

Larger Bench.
7.

Assuming the Revenue were to succeed before the larger Bench, and

the question referred to it is answered in the affirmative, it would mean that
it is sufficient that the satisfaction of the Assessing Officer for initiating
penalty proceedings against an Assessee under Section 271(1)(c) of the Act
is discernible from the assessment order itself and that such satisfaction
need not be separately or expressly indicated in the assessment order. In
that event the assessment order in the present case would have to be
examined

to find out if the satisfaction of the Assessing Officer is

discernible. Therefore, without expressing any view on the issue pending
consideration by the larger Bench, and presuming that the question referred
to it is answered in the affirmative, we proceed to examine the assessment
order in the instant case in order to find out whether the satisfaction of the
Assessing Officer that penalty proceedings should be initiated against the
Assessee under Section 271 (1) (c) of the Act is discernible therefrom.
8.

At the foot of the assessment orders, the Assessing Officer had

observed:
“Issue necessary forms. Penalty proceedings 271
(1)(c) have been initiated separately.”

9.

The above recording does not satisfy the requirement of Section 271

(1) (c ) of the Act as explained by this Court in
ITA Nos 1074 & 935/2006

Ram Commercial
page no 3 of 4

Enterprises Limited. Further even on a detailed perusal of the assessment
order no satisfaction of the Assessing Officer that penalty proceedings are
required to be initiated against the Assessee is discernible. None has also
been pointed out to us. Since the penalty proceedings cannot be sustained
on this basis we did not go into the merits of the matter.
10.

In addition it has been pointed out by Mr. C.S. Aggarwal, learned

senior counsel for the Assessee that in view of the subsequent developments
appeal effect has been given for the relevant assessment years 1995-96 and
1996-97, and by orders dated 29th March, 2000 passed by the Joint
Commissioner of Income Tax, income of the Assessee for both the years
has been assessed as Nil after adjusting unabsorbed depreciation of certain
previous assessment years. He accordingly submits that by virtue of the
decision of the Supreme Court in Virtual Soft Systems Limited v.
Commissioner of Income Tax [2007] 289 ITR 83 no penalty can be levied.
11.

No substantial question of law arises in these appeals. These appeals

are dismissed.
