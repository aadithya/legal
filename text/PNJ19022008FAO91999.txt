PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Vide impugned order dated 20.10.1998 appellant's

application under Order 9 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil
Procedure praying that the ex-parte judgment and decree
dated 10.5.1996 be recalled has been dismissed.
2.

In the application filed by the appellant it was stated

that on 4.10.1995 appellant's dispatch clerk received a postal
docket which on opening revealed that contents thereof were
only a plaint.

No summons were enclosed.

Appellant

contacted a local lawyer who advised that since only plaint was
received without summons, appellant should await receipt of

page 1 of 5

summons.

That none came.

That on 27.5.1997 appellant

learnt that its bank account was attached.

Inquiry revealed

that the attachment was issued by a learned Special Judge
First Class at Chandhigarh. Further inquiry revealed that the
learned Judge was executing, on transfer, a decree dated
10.5.1996 passed by Shri Lal Singh, Additional District Judge,
Delhi in the suit filed by the respondent.
3.

Evidence was led in the application filed by the

appellant. The appellant deposed that copy of the plaint AW1/2 was received but without the summons.

The opposite

party quizzed the witness of the appellant in relation to the
envelope

containing

the

plaint

for

the

obvious

reason

whenever summons are sent through post by Courts, on the
envelope, not only the name of the Court but even suit number
is mentioned.

Appellant stated that the envelope was

destroyed.
4.

View taken by the learned Judge is that the Court

record reveals that along with the plaint summons were
enclosed and the postal envelope was duly received by the
appellant as per A.D. card received back by the Court.
5.

The learned Judge has disbelieved the appellant vis-

a-vis its version that the summons were not found in the postal
docket. Thus it has been held that the appellant has failed to

show good cause for not appearing in the court.
6.

It is urged by learned counsel for the appellant that

the possibility of the Court Ahlmad preparing the summons but
negligently not attaching the same with the plaint before
enclosing the same in the envelope cannot be ruled out.
7.

I have questioned learned counsel for the appellant

as to why appellant did not contact the plaintiff whose name
and address was mentioned in the plaint to find out as to in
which Court the suit was filed.
8.

Learned counsel for the appellant has no answer.

9.

Further, the copy of the plaint received by the

appellant, if not more, disclosed to the appellant that the suit
was filed in the Court of the District Judge, Delhi.
10.

The plaint even bears the date being 21.7.1995.

11.

I have questioned the learned counsel for the

appellant as to why appellant did not make endeavour to find
out from the Court of the District Judge, Delhi particulars of
suits filed in the month of July 1995.

Indeed, there is no

answer.
12.

Counsel states that the appellant went

by

the

advice of the counsel.
13.

I am afraid, issues of common sense has not to be

the subject matter of legal opinion.

14.

To my mind, if appellant was confronted with the

situation which appellant claims it was, I see no reason why
appellant

did

not

firstly

write

to

the

plaintiff

seeking

information of the Court in which the suit was filed. Secondly, I
see no reason why appellant did not contact the Registry of the
District Judge, Delhi to ascertain the Court from which the
plaint was received by it.
15.

I note that the plaintiff is Children's Book Trust, 4

Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg, New Delhi. I find that in the plaint
claim is based on unpaid bills details whereof have been set
out in para 2 of the plaint.

I further note that in the plaint,

plaintiff has made reference to exchange of letters between
the parties.
16.

Any person with minimum use of common sense, on

reading the plaint, would have understood that Children's Book
Trust was seeking to recover unpaid dues under 9 bills stated
to have been raised and as disclosed in para 2 of the plaint.
Any

person

with

minimum

common

sense

would

have

contacted the plaintiff to acquaint himself with the Court in
which the plaint was filed.
17.

I see no infirmity in the impugned order passed by

the learned Trial Judge dismissing appellant's application under
Order 39 Rule 13 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

TCR be returned forthwith.
