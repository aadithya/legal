VIPIN SANGHI, J.
1.

By this order I propose to dispose of I.A. No.5136/1996 filed

under Order 39 Rules 1 and 2 CPC by the plaintiff and I.A. No.
6799/1996 under Order 12 rule 6 CPC filed by defendant No. 2.
2.

This Suit has been filed by M/s. Phase Finance & Investment

Pvt. Ltd., for seeking relief of a decree of Specific Performance of an
CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 1 of 15

agreement to sell executed with the defendants dated 22.5.1995
whereby property bearing No.E-54, Greater Kailash, Part II, New
Delhi, was agreed to be sold to the plaintiff for a total consideration
of Rs.1,28,50,000/-.
3.

The admitted position is that the parties entered into an

agreement to sell on 22.5.1995 in respect of the suit property. The
two defendants are real brothers, defendant no.1 being the elder of
the two.
PLAINTIFF’S AVERMENTS

4.

At the time of executing the said agreement to sell, a sum of

Rs.21 lakhs as advance payment was made by way of

banker’s

cheque and the same were duly encashed by defendants. The
remaining Rs.1,07,50,000/- was to be paid at the time of execution
and registration of documents and handing over of the vacant
possession of the suit property. Before the execution and registration
of the sale deed could be affected the parties were required to obtain
permission under Section 269 of the Income Tax Act 1961 from the
Appropriate Authority as also a certificate under Section 230A of the
Income Tax Act.

5.

Permission was granted by the Appropriate Authority to the

plaintiff in August 1995. Thereafter, the plaintiff approached the
CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 2 of 15

defendants

for

completion

of

the

transaction.

However,

the

defendants expressed their inability to complete the transaction as
the permission under Section 34A of the Income Tax Act was not
forthcoming.

6.

Therefore a supplementary agreement was executed where

under the plaintiff agreed to pay 2% interest on the balance
consideration.

This was done under duress and plaintiff was not

bound by the said supplementary agreement.

7.

The Bank Draft got prepared by the plaintiff for payment of the

balance consideration was later got cancelled due to lapse of time.
Proposed sale deed to facilitate procurement of certificate from
income tax authorities was also supplied but no progress was made in
the matter by the defendants. Thereafter legal notice was issued to
the defendants whereby they were called upon to obtain the
necessary permissions and complete the transaction.

8.

Defendant no. 2, Saurabh Prakash in reply expressed his

willingness to complete the transaction but indicated that it was
defendant no. 1, Samir Prakash who had certain issues. Since his
share in property was not separately demarcated, sale deed could not
be executed.

CS(OS)1404-1996

Defendant no. 1 when approached, also assured the

Page 3 of 15

plaintiff of his intentions to honour his obligations under the
agreement.

9.

Thereafter plaintiff came to know of efforts being made by the

defendants to dispose of the property and thus, the present suit was
filed.

Proceedings so far:

10.

The suit was registered and an ex parte order of interim

injunction was passed on 3.6.1996 directing the defendants to
maintain status quo with respect to the said property.

11.

The

parties

entered

appearance

and

filed

their

written

statement as well as replies to the application u/O 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC.

12.

The defendant no. 1 also filed a separate suit for damages being suit

no. 1399/98 against the plaintiff and defendant No. 2 herein on the basis of
the alleged breach of the aforesaid agreement to sell. The said suit is being
listed with the present suit from time to time.

Defendant No. 1’s Contentions:

13.

Defendant No. 1 has not opposed the continuance of the

injunction, though he disputes the claim of the plaintiff on merits.
CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 4 of 15

However, he candidly states that the continuance of the injunction
suits him since there is inter se dispute between him and his brother
defendant No. 2 in relation to the suit property. On merits he submits
that the plaintiff has concocted facts and misled the Court. The
plaintiff is acting in collusion with defendant No. 2 and both have
deliberately not pointed out the repeated breaches of understandings
arrived at between the parties from time to time.

Defendant No. 2’s contentions.

14.

The agreement to sell was executed in the name of Phase

Finance Pvt. Ltd. Application for permission in form 37I was signed
by the defendants in the name of ‘Phase Finance Pvt. Ltd.’.

15.

Plaintiff filed the application for permission in Form 37I after

unilaterally changing the name of the buyer on 30.5.1995 to ‘Phase
Finance and Investment

Pvt. Ltd.’ On 26.6.1995, proposed sale

deed was entered into between ‘Phase Finance Pvt. Ltd.’ and the
defendants and the change of name was not intimated to the
defendants.

16.

On 28.6.1995, notice for issuance of certificate under the Urban

Land (Ceiling & Regulation) Act was given by the parties. However

CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 5 of 15

change in name of the proposed buyer was not communicated even
at this stage.

17.

In July 1995, Mr. Subhash Arora (Representative of plaintiff)

informed the defendants that name of the company was incorrectly
stated and it ought to have been ‘Phase Finance and Investment
Pvt. Ltd.’ Defendants demanded interest @ 2% of the balance
consideration on account of the delay in completion of the transaction
due to the said mistake for which the plaintiff was responsible.
However, the plaintiff did not accede to the same and transaction
could not proceed further. Around 20th July the plaintiff agreed to pay
interest

@

2%

per

month

w.e.f.

16.9.1995

on

the

balance

consideration for the period of delay and communicated it via an
undated letter. On 1.8.1995, Mr.Arora signed another letter agreeing
to pay the interest as aforesaid. Thereafter, on 7.8.1995 the
defendant No. 2 applied for permission in Form 34A. On 21.8.1995,
the plaintiff was granted permission in Form 37I in the name of
‘Phase Finance & Investment Pvt. Ltd.’
18.

On 13.10.1995, certificate under Urban Land (Ceiling and

Regulation)

Act

granted.

In

November

1995,

the

Assistant

Commissioner of Income Tax called for the amended agreement to
sell and amended proposed sale deed with the corrected name of the
transferee. Defendant No. 2 prepared 3 sets of the proposed sale
CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 6 of 15

deed and obtained signatures of Mr. Subhash Arora and handed the
same to defendant No.1 on 30.11.1995. Defendant no.2,

however,

refused to sign the said document.
19.

Thereafter, a couple of documents were drawn up by one or

the other defendant, but due to disagreement, the same did not result
in an agreement signed by all the parties.
20.

The defendant No. 2 got issued a notice to defendant No. 1 on

13.1.1996 and thereafter the plaintiff sent the legal notice to the
defendants. Plaintiff was informed of the intention of defendant No. 2
to complete the transaction on payment of interest @ 2% per month
w.e.f. 16.9.1995 till date of payment. However, no reply was received
from the plaintiff. Thereafter several rounds of negotiations were held
from February 1996 to May 1996. On 15.5.1996, defendant No. 2
wrote to the Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax apprising him of
the fact that amended sale deed could not be obtained, therefore, he
would execute only the proposed sale deed already furnished to him.
On 7.6.1996, the permission was refused by the income tax
authorities.
21.

The plaintiff thereafter filed this suit on the basis of

certain documents interpolated by him and therefore he is not
entitled to any equitable relief of injunction. The plaintiff has also,
subsequent to the filing of this suit, acted in a manner disentitling

CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 7 of 15

him from any relief as even after filing of written statement by
defendant No. 2 he failed to file his replication for almost two years.
The agreement was entered into with ‘M/s. Phase Finance Pvt.
Ltd.’ and not with the plaintiff. Thus, the only agreement that the
plaintiff could have sought to enforce was the agreement dated
22.8.1995 as modified vide an undated letter of plaintiff, and further
modified by letter dated 1.8.1995. Since plaintiff failed to plead and
seek specific performance of the contract as it finally stood, he is now
disentitled from seeking the equitable relief being claimed.
Plaintiff’s response:
22.

The error in statement of name is no ground in itself for

refusing the relief of specific performance of contract. More so when
this fact was brought to the attention of the defendants and no
objections were raised thereon. The change in name was necessitated
by a genuine and bona fide error.

23.

The contract was entered with both the defendants and

contradictory and mutually destructive stand taken by the defendants
does not concern it. Form 37I was not tampered with by the plaintiff,
and defendants were always aware of the change made. The change
was necessitated due to the bona fide error, and the plaintiff agreed
to pay 2% interest on the balance. Delay, if any, was attributable to
the defendants.
CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 8 of 15

24.

Several meetings took place between the defendant No. 2 and

Mr. Subhash Arora and Mr. Rajesh Kumar on behalf of plaintiff so
that an understanding on the issue may be arrived at.

25.

The plaintiff never intended to take advantage of an indefinite

extension of period of time for conclusion of sale. On the other hand,
it was the defendants

who were delaying conclusion of the

agreement by raising some controversy or the other. The 2% interest
was offered by the plaintiff as a goodwill gesture being contingent on
defendants taking prompt steps to conclude the transaction. Since
delay is attributable to the defendants,

no question of payment of

interest arises.

DISCUSSION AND DECISION

26.

From the stand taken by the parties, prima-facie, it appears

that due to typographical error while executing the agreement to sell
the name of the plaintiff was wrongly typed as `M/s. Phase Finance
Pvt. Ltd’ instead of M/s. Phase Finance and Investment Pvt. Ltd.
It further appears that when this discrepancy was brought to the
notice of the defendants they felt aggrieved since the completion of
transaction was pushed back, which also meant that receipt of
balance consideration of Rs.1,07,50,000/- would also be delayed. It
appears that to remedy the loss of interest that the defendants would
CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 9 of 15

have suffered on account of such delay, on the demand of the
defendants, the plaintiff agreed to pay interest @ 2% per month w.e.f.
16.9.1995 for the period of delay. Prima-facie this appears to be a
reasonable arrangement arrived at between the parties. It also
appears that even after the receipt of the requisite permission under
Section 269 UC of the Income Tax Act as well as clearance under the
Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, the transaction got struck
primarily on account of the refusal of defendant No. 1 to sign and
deliver a copy of proposed sale deed to be furnished to the Income
Tax Authorities for obtaining a certificate under Section 230A of the
Income Tax Act. To that extent, it prima-facie appears that the
defendant No. 1 was in breach of his obligations.

27.

Since the plaintiff had dealt with both the defendants as the

proposed sellers and the defendants acted jointly, even though
defendant No. 2 may not have been in breach, so far as plaintiff is
concerned both the defendants would have to face the consequences
of such a breach. It may be that defendant No. 2 may be entitled to,
in turn, claim damages from defendant No. 1 on account of his
conduct in relation to the agreement to sell. However, that is a
separate matter and the plaintiff would obviously not be concerned
with the inter se disputes between the two defendants.

CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 10 of 15

28.

The Plaintiff has filed the present suit on a categorical stand

that the agreement where under he agreed to pay 2% interest for the
delayed period was executed by it under coercion and duress.
However, the Plaintiff has not sought any relief in respect of the said
subsequent agreement. The original agreement to sell dated 22nd May
1995, stood novated upon the Plaintiff agreeing to pay interest @ 2%
per month with effect from 16.9.1995 on the balance consideration
for the period of delay. Once an agreement has been novated it is the
novated agreement of which specific performance can be sought and
not to the original agreement (See Section 62 of the Contract Act and
Section 18 of the Specfic Relief Act).

29.

However, the Plaintiff is seeking the specific performance of

the original agreement to sell itself and is disowning the novation on
the ground of duress and coercion. The Plaintiff did not disclose in
the plaint the fact that the name of the Plaintiff had wrongly been
typed in the agreement to sell or that the same has been incorrectly
mentioned in Form 37I or any other document. It is not disclosed by
the Plaintiff that the agreement to pay interest @ 2% per month on
the delayed payment from 16.9.1995 onwards was arrived at to
compensate the Defendants for delay that may be occasioned on
account of the mistake of the Plaintiff in incorrectly mentioning the
name of the Plaintiff in Form 37I and the agreement to sell dated

CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 11 of 15

22.5.1995.

These

are

material

facts,

which

the

Plaintiff

has

conveniently omitted to mention in the plaint or the interim
application. Moreover, when Defendant No. 2 brought out these facts
in his written statement the same were not denied by the Plaintiff. In
fact, the perusal of the replication of the Plaintiff to the written
statement of Defendant No. 2 shows that even in respect of
agreement to pay interest @ 2%, the stand of the Plaintiff is different
in their replication from what it is in the plaint. The Plaintiff does not
specifically deny the allegations of Defendant No. 2 that the Plaintiff
had inserted the words 'and investment' in the agreement to sell
dated 22.5.1995 filed in this court to get over the difficulty of having
to explain the matter. Paragraph 9 under the heading Brief Facts, in
the written statement of Defendant No. 2 and corresponding
paragraph in the Plaintiff's replication may be seen in this regard.

30.

It would have been a different matter, had the Plaintiff in its

suit made a complete disclosure and had taken the stand that it is
liable to pay interest @ 2% per month from 16.9.1995 onwards only
for a limited period since further delay was on account of conduct of
the Defendants, and in particular Defendant No. 1.

However, the

Plaintiff has completely sought to deny its obligation and liability to
pay any amount of interest whatsoever. This conduct of the Plaintiff

CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 12 of 15

also impinges on the readiness and willingness of the Plaintiff to
perform his part of the agreement as novated.

31.

In view of the aforesaid conduct of the Plaintiff, in my view,

even though it were the defendants and in particular Defendant No. 1
who were subsequently in breach of the agreement to sell as novated,
the Plaintiff would not, prima facie, be entitled to a decree of specific
performance in respect of agreement to sell dated 22.5.1995. At the
same time, on account of the fact that it was Defendant No. 1 who
was in breach of the agreement to sell, it would be inequitable to let
off the defendants and to permit them to deal with the suit property
unless and until they jointly or severally deposit in this Court an
amount of Rs.21 lakhs admittedly received by them under the
agreement to sell 22.5.1995. For in suit for specific performance of a
contract where the relief of specific performance may not be granted
to a plaintiff, he may be entitled to seek refund of earnest money or
compensation for breach, if any, if the facts of the case so demand.

32.

Accordingly I vacate

the ex-parte

injunction passed on 3.6.1996

ad interim orders of

in I.A.No.5136/1996 subject to the

Defendants depositing in this court an amount of Rs.21 lakhs jointly
and severally within two months from the passing of this order. In
case the deposit is not made within two months, the Defendants will
be required to deposit the said amount alongwith interest @ 12% per
CS(OS)1404-1996

Page 13 of 15

annum from the date of this order till the date of deposit, only
whereafter the ex-parte ad interim orders of injunction dated
3.6.1996 shall stand vacated.

33.

So far as I.A. No. 6799/1996 is concerned, I do not find any

merit in the same. Defendant No. 2 could not insist that the Plaintiff
pay to him 50% of the balance sale consideration since he was
agreeable to complete his part of the transaction. This is so because
the Plaintiff had agreed to purchase the entire suit property from
both the Defendants jointly. If the Defendant No. 1 was resiling from
the agreement, Defendant No. 2 as a co-sharer cannot take the stand
that he is not concerned with the conduct of Defendant No. 1 and that
he is only concerned about his own interests and affairs and on that
basis seek to enforce the agreement which is a single transaction
between the Plaintiff and Defendant No. 1 and 2. The plaintiff could
not be expected to be out of pocket by over 50% of the sale
consideration and yet not have a marketable title with the right to
possess and enjoy even 50% of the suit property. Accordingly I.A. No.
6799/96 is dismissed.

Any observations made by me in this order is

only tentative and shall not come in the way of the parties at the final
stage.
