:

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

The appellant is aggrieved by the order dated

14.1.1993 holding that the Courts at Delhi have no territorial
jurisdiction to entertain the plaint. The plaint has been ordered
to be returned.
2.

While arriving at the conclusion learned Trial Judge

has held as under :“Obviously, the payments were to be made at
Faridabad and the plea raised by the
FAO No.53/93

page 1 of 5

defendant is not devoid of any merit and
substance.”
3.

Further finding returned is that admittedly the

factory of the defendant is situated at Faridabad and the bills
on which suit was based evidenced that the goods were
supplied at Faridabad.

It has been further held that merely

because defendant had one of its office at Delhi would not
confer jurisdiction on the Courts at Delhi.
4.

It may be noted that the plaint has been returned

without any evidence being recorded.
5.

Issue therefore has to be decided with reference to

the averments made in the plaint and no more.
6.

A perusal of the plaint evidences that suit sought

recovery of Rs.80,000/-. Defendant, a company registered
under the Companies Act was sued at Delhi with respect to not
only its registered office being at Delhi but also on the
averments made in the plaint as under :“The plaintiff had been supplying the goods to
the defendant from Delhi office and an
account was opened by the plaintiff in the
account books of the plaintiff regularly
maintained............. The defendant had been
making payments from its head office at Delhi
to the plaintiff or from the Faridabad office of
the plaintiff. The amount was payable at
Delhi and the orders used to be placed by the
defendant to the plaintiff at Delhi.”

7.

I fail to understand as to how learned Trial Judge

has recorded a finding that obviously the payments were to be
made at Faridabad.
8.

In the teeth of the averments made in the plaint

that the

payments which were made at Delhi and that

remaining payments had to be made at Delhi said finding
cannot be sustained.
9.

Even otherwise, issue of territorial jurisdiction has to

be decided with reference to Sections 16 to Sections 20 of the
Code of Civil Procedure.
10.

For money suits, the place where the defendant

actually resides or carries on business would be the place
where a suit can be filed. For a corporate entity, the residence
of the defendant would be the place where its registered office
is situated. Further, even in respect of the place where cause
of action wholly or in part arises would be the place of
territorial jurisdiction. In the instant case I notice that in the
plaint a specific averment has been made to the effect that the
plaintiff has an office at Delhi as well as Faridabad and that
deliveries were made to the defendant at its factory at
Faridabad from both offices. It has been categorically averred
that a single account at plaintiff's head office was maintained
and that payments had been made by the defendant to the
FAO No.53/93

page 3 of 5

Head Office for not only the goods supplied from the Head
Office at Delhi but even from the Branch Office of the plaintiff
at Faridabad.

It has also been pleaded that orders used to be

placed by the defendant on the plaintiff at Delhi.
11.

Suffice would it be to state the place where

payments are made or are supposed to be made would be the
place where part cause of action would accrue. Similarly place
where order is placed would also be the place where cause of
action accrues.
12.

The appeal is accordingly allowed.

13.

Impugned order dated 14.1.1993 is set aside. Issue

No.1, i.e. 'Whether this Court has not territorial jurisdiction to
entertain the present suit? OPD' is decided in favour of the
plaintiff and against the defendant holding that on the
averments made in the plaint courts at Delhi would have
territorial jurisdiction.
14.

TCR be returned forthwith.

15.

Noting that the suit was filed in the year 1992 I

direct the learned Trial Judge to expedite the disposal of the
suit and try and pronounce decision by the end of the current
calender year.
16.

Needless to state, learned Trial Judge would serve

notice of the suit being restored upon the defendant before
FAO No.53/93

page 4 of 5

proceeding ahead in accordance with law.
17.

No costs.
