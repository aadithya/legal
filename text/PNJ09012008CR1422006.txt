:

PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

The petitioner takes exception to an order dated

27.3.2006 holding that a perusal of the plaint shows that vis-avis the petitioner Courts at Delhi have jurisdiction.
2.

First respondent had filed a suit for recovery

alleging that a lease agreement was entered into between it
and defendant No.1 'LML Fibres Ltd'.

It was alleged that

defendant No.1 changed name and was known as 'M/s.Esslon

Page 1 of 3

Synthetics Ltd'. M/s.Esslon Synthetics Ltd. was impleaded as
defendant No.2. Petitioner was impleaded as defendant No.3
on the averment that it had stood as a guarantor to repay the
outstanding amount under the lease agreement should the
lessee be in default.
3.

Before proceeding ahead with further narration I

may note that the plaint has been drafted most unartistically.
The author of the plaint is not conscious of the fact that when a
company changes the name a single entity remains.

Thus,

defendants No.1 and 2 are the one and the same entity. The so
called defendant No.1 does not exist for the reason its name
has got changed to the name of defendant No.2.
4.

Be that as it may, further narration of the facts

require me to note that in para 13 of the plaint, pertaining to
accrual of cause of action and conclusions to be drawn thereto
with respect to territorial jurisdiction, following has been
pleaded:“13.
That the cause of action arose from time to
time from the date of default of each quarter as and
when the installment became due. The defendants
paid by cheque last payment on 6th July, 1985 for a
sum of Rs.6,000/-. The payment of installments, as
agreed, had been payable at New Delhi at the
registered office of the plaintiff and the payments
made in respect of the quarters earlier in dates had
been actually made at New Delhi. The agreement of
lease deed and of guarantee made on 25th January
1991 was executed and made at New Delhi. In view
Page 2 of 3

thereof the whole cause of action arose in Delhi.”
5.

Since

M/s.Esslon

Synthetics

Ltd.

proceeded

to

liquidation, plaintiff gave up relief against defendants No.1 and
2. The suit continued only against the petitioner, impleaded as
defendant No.3.
6.

According

to

the

petitioner,

having

given

up

defendants No.1 and 2, averments in the plaint relatable to
said defendants it to be eschewed while determining territorial
jurisdiction vis-a-vis the cause pleaded against it.
7.

Learned

Trial

Judge

has

opined

against

the

petitioner.
8.

Suffice would it be to note that in para 13 of the

plaint it has been specifically averred that the guarantee in
question furnished by the petitioner was executed at Delhi.
This averment is sufficient to clothe jurisdiction at Delhi.
9.

I may clarify. If petitioner denies having executed

guarantee at Delhi, said dispute would be a question of fact to
be answered at the time of final adjudication and in light of the
evidence led; on issue being framed.
10.

I find no merits in the petition.

11.

Dismissed.
