ORDER:
IA No.12971/2006
By this application(I.A.No.12971/2006) made by defendants

No.1 & 2 under Order 1 Rule 10(2) read with section 151 CPC, defendants
have sought striking out the name of Ms H.A. Daruwalla as defendant No.2
for being improperly joined & not being a necessary party and to add the
name of Danske Bank, Odense, Denmark as a necessary party.

It is

stated in the application that plaintiffs filed a suit for the recovery of
Rs.20,03,220/- as damages against defendants No.1 & 2 allegedly causing
delay of 34 days in affording credit for proceeds of USD 4400 remitted by
defendant No.3 from Denmark to the account of plaintiff No.1. Defendant
filed a written statement and also filed a Counter Claim claiming Rs.10
crores as damages alleging in the Counter Claim that plaintiffs No.1 & 2
(defendants

No.1

&

2

in

counter

claim)

have

deliberately

and

mischievously damaged the image of defendant No.1 by making
recklessly false averments in the plaint repeatedly in order to bail out M/s

CS(OS) No.1639.06

Page 1of 5

Euro Partner, Denmark and/or Danske Bank, Denmark. The mischievous
effort on the part of plaintiffs No.1 & 2 has been to circulate defamatory
averments against defendant No.1(plaintiff in the counter claim) before an
International audience. The intention of plaintiffs No.1 & 2 was mala fide
and it was only to defame the defendant No.1 (plaintiff in the Counter
Claim) before an International audience. It is also stated that plaintiffs
No.1 & 2(defendants in the counter claim) gave access to the documents
containing downright false, mischievous and defamatory averments
against defendant No.1(plaintiff in the Counter Claim) in Denmark to
defendant No.3 and there was a collusion between

the plaintiffs and

common intention was to falsely pass on the blame for a delayed foreign
inward remittance amounting to USD 4400 to the plaintiff and to bail out
defendant No.3 and/or Denske, Denmark.
2.

It is stated that Denske Bank, Denmark was a necessary

party and therefore, should be impleaded as a defendant to the suit.
IA No.4329/2007
3.

The second application I.A. No.4329/07 under Order 1 Rule

10(2) read with section 151 CPC is by defendant No.4 i.e. for striking out
the name of defendant No.4 i.e. Danske Bank, from the Counter Claim.
The contention of Danske Bank is that Danske Bank was neither a
necessary party nor a party against whom any relief has been claimed nor
any allegations have been made against defendant No.4 in the Counter
Claim. Therefore, the defendant No.4 was not a necessary party and has
been wrongly impleaded as a party.
4.

Brief facts relevant for the purpose of deciding these two

applications are that in Suit No.1369/2006 plaintiffs filed a claim making
Central Bank of India and its Chairperson & Managing Director as
defendants No.1 & 2 and Managing Director, M/s Euro Partners as
defendant No.3 . This suit was filed for the recovery of Rs.20,03,220/- as
damages against defendant No.1 and 2 i.e. Central Bank of India and its
Chairperson. No relief was claimed from defendant No.3. The damages

CS(OS) No.1639.06

Page 2of 5

were sought on the ground that Central Bank of India had acted
negligently in not remitting the amount of USD 4400 to the foreign buyer
i.e. defendant No. 3 in accordance with the instructions issued by the
plaintiffs. It is stated that defendant No.1 raised proforma invoice dated
20.10.2005 upon M/s Euro Partner APS for net balance of USD 4400.
Defendant No.3 instructed Danske Bank, the bankers of its company to
remit USD 4400 to plaintiff No.1 to be credited in the account through
defendant No.1 against the invoice.

The said remittance was made

electronically through corresponding bank & was almost instantaneous.
The remittance should reached to defendant No.1 not later than
28.10.2005. The delivery of goods was to take place to defendant No.3
only after the receipt remittance.

It is stated that defendant No.1 had

been negligent and did not trace the amount remitted by defendant No.3
and due to this, the plaintiffs more particularly plaintiff No.2 suffered
personal humiliation, discredit ill-repute and allegations of dishonesty at
the hands of defendant No.3. The plaintiff has enumerated the facts to
plead that it was defendant No.1 which was solely liable for the
humiliation suffered at the hands of defendant No.3 and hence the suit.
5.

Defendant No.1 in turn filed counter claim as already stated.

6.

It is apparent from the pleadings of the plaintiffs and

defendant No.1 in the Counter Claim that plaintiffs in CS No.1639/2006
have wrongly made Chairperson & Managing Director of defendant No.1
as a party. Chairperson & Managing Director never acted in the personal
capacity while corresponding to the plaintiffs. She was acting on behalf of
the bank and it would be the bank and bank alone who would be liable, if
proved for the damages. Only that person is a necessary party in a suit,
without whose presence a substantial decree cannot be made or without
whom a claim cannot be legally settled by the Court.
7.

The Chairperson in this case is not a necessary party since

claims against the bank can be settled in his absence as well. I, therefore,
allow the application (I.A. No.12971/2006) made by defendants No.1 &

CS(OS) No.1639.06

Page 3of 5

2 for deleting the name of Ms. H.A. Daruwalla from array of parties in CS
No.1639/2006.

However, defendant No.1 is a necessary party since

damages have been claimed from defendant No.1. I find no force in the
application of defendant Nos.1 & 2 that Danske Bank was a necessary
party either in the plaint or in the Counter Claim. A plaintiff has a right to
chose as to against whom he has to make the claim and what would be
the nature of claim. A plaintiff can give up a part of the claim and can
also give up some of the defendants. It is a liberty given to the plaintiff
under law and therefore, the plaintiff cannot be compelled to make
somebody as a defendant when plaintiff does not want to claim any relief
from that person. It would be for the defendant in a suit to show that no
case was made out against him. It is not for the defendant to show that
the case was made out against some other person. I, therefore, consider
that the application (I.A.No.12971/2006) made by defendants Nos.1 & 2
in CS No.1639/06 for making Danske Bank, a necessary party is not
maintainable and is hereby dismissed.
8.

In the counter claim filed by defendant No.1 Bank registered

as CC-2330/06, Central Bank of India has made allegations of defamation
against defendants No.1 & 2(plaintiffs in suit).

The contention of the

Central Bank of India is that defendants No.1 & 2 wanted to bail out
defendants No.3 & 4. Assuming this to be correct bailing out defendants
No.3 & 4 is not an offence, neither gives any rise to claim in favour of
Central Bank of India. Since Central Bank of India's counter claim is for
damages because of defamation done by defendants No.1 & 2 by
defamatory pleadings and circulating pleadings and documents before the
International audience, and no allegations have been made against
defendant No.4 in respect of any defamation or circulating any letter or
document making any defamatory averments,

I consider in order to

decide counter claim of Central Bank of India, Danske Bank is not a
necessary party.
9.

I, therefore, allow the application(I.A. No.4329/2007) and

CS(OS) No.1639.06

Page 4of 5

the name of Danske Bank, defendant No.4 is deleted from the array of
parties in the counter claim filed by defendants.
10.

Let amended memo of parties be filed by defendant

No.1(plaintiff in the counter claim)and the plaintiffs in the suit.
IA Nos.6258/2007 and 3489/2007
In view of allowing the application being IA No.4329/07 of
defendant No.4 & defendant No.4 having been deleted from the array of
parties, these applications have become infructuous and disposed of as
such.
CS(OS) No.1639/2006
List the suit before the Joint Registrar for admission/denial, if
any and for completion of pleadings on 27th March, 2008. Thereafter it be
listed before Court for framing of issues on 8th July, 2008

February 21, 2008.
