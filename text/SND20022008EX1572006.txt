ORDER:
EA NO.114/2007

1.

This application has been made by the Judgment Debtor for

restitution of the execution petition which was disposed of as satisfied
claiming that the Decree Holder had received an amount of Rs.24,348.64,
which is more than the awarded amount, by misrepresentation of facts
before the Court and, therefore, this amount should be got refunded to
the JD and an order be passed directing the JD to pay back this amount.
2.

The basis of the applicant/judgment debtor making this claim is the

claim No.15 of the award. The claim No.15 of the Award reads as under:“Claim No.15:

Claimants claim Rs.1,08,000/-

as interest on investment of Rs.2,00,000/- for
execution period @ 24% per annum.
The legitimate dues of the claimants were
withheld by the respondents and the claimants were
deprived of the use of their money. Therefore interest

01.05.91 (i.e. the date before I entered upon reference).
I also award 14% pendente lite interest on
Rs.2,20,511.04 from 02.05.91 to 20.08.93.
I also award 14% interest from the date of award
till, decree or realization whichever is earlier.
The total amount of interest under this claim will
not exceed Rs.1,08,000/-.”

3.

The claimant has claimed that the total interest payable to the

claimant was Rs.1,08,000/- inclusive of future interest, pendente lite and
past interest whereas the decree holder has calculated future interest @
14% from 20.8.93 till 1.5.06 amounting to Rs.6,03,298/-. The decree
holder could not have claimed this amount since under claim No.15, the
Arbitrator had granted total interest limited to Rs.1,08,000/- only.
4.

A perusal of award in respect of claim No.15 shows that the

claimant had claimed interest of Rs.1,08,000/- as interest up to the filing
of the claim before the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator awarded pre-suit
interest of Rs.76,173/- from 15.1.1987 to 1.5.1991 and awarded pendente
lite interest @ 14% at Rs.2,20,511 from 2.5.91 to 20.8.93. The Arbitrator
also awarded 14% interest from the date of award till the decree was
realized, whichever was earlier.
5.

Looking into the fact that the claimant had claimed a total interest

of Rs.1,08,000/- as interest on investment, the Arbitrator restricted the
claim of interest by the claimant to Rs.1,08,000/-. Obviously, this
restriction was in respect of pendente lite and past interest. This
restriction could not have been in respect of future interest. Pendente lite
EA No.114/2007 in Ex.P. No. 157/2006

Page No.2 of 4

and past interest itself amounted to more than Rs.1,08,000/-. If the
Arbitrator wanted that the entire interest was to be restricted only to Rs.
1,08,000/-, he would not have awarded the future interest at all. The very
fact that the Arbitrator awarded future interest @ 14%, shows that the
restriction of Rs.1,08,000/- was only in respect of pendente lite and presuit interest and not on future interest. I consider that the stand taken by
the JD in this application is not tenable.
6.

The calculations made by the JD would show that the awarded

amount was Rs.3,30,511/- whereas the decree holder calculated an award
amount wrongly as Rs.3,39,313/- and the decree holder also calculated
future interest on this amount. The various claims allowed by the
Arbitrator are as under:Claim No.1

-

Rs.23,352

Claim No.2

-

Rs.5,000

Claim No.4

-

Rs.34,057.72

Claim No.6

-

Rs.18,763.32

Claim No.10 & 11 Claim No. 15

-

Rs.1,08,000/-

Claim No.16

-

Rs.54,938/-

Claim No.17

-

Rs.2,000/-

Total
7.

Rs.84,400/-

-

Rs.3,30,511.04/-

Thus the total award was for Rs.3,30,511.04/-. A perusal of

execution would show that the decree holder wrongly stated that the
awarded amount was Rs.3,39,313/-. Thus, there is a difference of
Rs.8802/- in the awarded amount plus interest on this amount @ 14%
has also been wrongly paid to Decree Holder and the further calculations
EA No.114/2007 in Ex.P. No. 157/2006

Page No.3 of 4

of 9% on this amount has also been wrongly charged. The decree holder
has, therefore, received some additional amount by not giving correct
awarded amount.
8.

Let the Judgment Debtor file calculations on the basis of awarded

amount of Rs.3,30,511+future interest @ 14% per annum from 20.8.93 to
1.5.2006 and interest of 9% till 23.7.2006.

JD would be entitled to

recover the difference. Let the calculations be filed within one week.
9.

With above directions, the application stands disposed of.
