PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Heard learned counsel for the parties.

2.

DDA's grievance is to the order dated 13.10.2006

dismissing its application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act
praying that delay in filing the appeal be condoned.
3.

The decree against DDA is dated 6.2.2006. It has

returned a finding in favour of the plaintiffs that the suit land
ad-measuring 500 sq. yards as per site plan Ex.PW1/1 is
comprised in Khasra No.399, Gujaran Khadar, Ghonda, Bhajan
FAO No.429/07

page 1 of 8

Pura, Delhi.

Dismissing the application seeking delay to be

condoned in filing the appeal, learned Appellate Judge has held
that no sufficient cause has been shown entitling the DDA to
have the delay condoned. It was noted that appeal was filed
on 31.7.2006.
4.

It is not in dispute that limitation for filing the appeal

is 30 days.
5.

It may be observed at the inception that I do not

blame the learned Appellate Judge for the view taken for the
reason the application filed under Section 5 of the Limitation
Act is as vague as vagueness can ever be.
6.

When the matter was heard by me on 22.3.2007 I

had called upon learned counsel for DDA to show the relevant
record to satisfy myself whether a mechanical decision was
taken to file the appeal as also to satisfy myself as to how the
file was processed by DDA after the Trial Court decreed the
suit.
7.

Notings in the file of the department had been

shown to me. Photocopies thereof were filed. Only thereafter
notice was issued on 22.3.2007.
8.

Learned counsel for DDA states that he would

instruct the department that in future whenever a situation of
the kind reoccurs the departmental notings would be tabulated
FAO No.429/07

page 2 of 8

and made a part of the application under Section 5 of the
Limitation Act.

Indeed, had this exercise been carried out

before the learned Appellate Judge, a round of further litigation
may have been avoided.
9.

It is trite that sans negligence, there can hardly be

ever a delay. Every delay would have some facet or the other
of the negligence.

Thus, one has not to look at negligence

while considering delay to be condoned.

Issue has to be

considered whether a party was bona fide taking steps to
prosecute the appellate remedy. Further, issue of condonation
of delay has not to be construed pedantically i.e. one has not
to look at each day's delay separately. It is settled law that
issues of procedure have to be construed liberally to give
effect to substantive rights of a party unless the compelling
language does not so permit and there is a presumption that
every party intends to avail of substantive rights and
consciously does not do or refrain from doing something which
takes away a substantive right. Further, where the litigating
party is a corporate entity, the hierarchical structure in the
organisation in the decision making process has to be
considered.

Further, where

the litigating

party is the

Government or a statutory authority, public interest has also to
be kept in view. Lastly if costs are good recompense for the
FAO No.429/07

page 3 of 8

inconvenience caused to the opposite party said course should
be chartered.
10.

With this understanding of the law, relevant facts as

emerging from the notings in the file of DDA have to be noted.
11.

But before that, it has to be noted that as per the

respondent i.e. the plaintiffs, suit land was comprised in Khasra
No.399. According to DDA it was comprised in Khasra No.405
belonging to DDA.
12.

The counsel engaged by DDA applied for a certified

copy of the judgment and decree dated 6.2.2006 on 8.2.2006.
He did so promptly. The certified copy was made available to
the counsel by the registry in Tis Hazari on 28.2.2006.

On

6.3.2006

the

learned

department.

counsel

transmitted

the

same

to

The file was received in the department on

9.3.2006. The Senior Law Officer of DDA who received the file
on 9.3.2006 processed the same on the same date and
required the Junior Law Officer to put up a note. The Junior Law
Officer considered the suit record and put a note dated
21.3.2006 to the effect that the issue centers around a
demarcation report by the Local Commissioner appointed by
the Court.

He further opined that land comprised in Khasra

No.405 was acquired vide award No.9/73/74. He also opined,
with reference to the witnesses examined that it was debatable
FAO No.429/07

page 4 of 8

as to in which khasra the land was situated.

No doubt, he

concluded the opinion by recommending an appeal to be filed,
but I note that there is a tendency in departments not to
conclude issues even when the same are prima facie opined to
be conclusive, lest allegations are made against the officer
concerned.
13.

Be that as it may, the Senior Law Officer to whom

the file was marked penned a 3 page note dated 28.3.2006
opining that revenue record prima facie suggested that the
decision of the learned Trial Judge was wrong. He opined that
an appeal should be filed.
14.

The competent authority,namely, the Deputy Chief

Legal Advisor to whom the file was transmitted on 28.3.2006
had a re-look.

He opined that it would be useless to file an

appeal for the sake of it. He opined that a meeting be held
with the Revenue Department for only if the Revenue
Department of DDA could justify that the demarcation report
was incorrect and the land in question was comprised in Khasra
No.405, only then an appeal should be filed.

Time

was

consumed thereafter to issue orders to various officers in the
Revenue Department to join the meeting. On 28.4.2006, post
meeting, the Deputy Chief Legal Advisor once again opined
that, the issue not being brought out with clarity by his officers,
FAO No.429/07

page 5 of 8

he was still of the view that appeal should be filed only if the
administrative department established that the suit land falls in
Khasra No.405. Thereafter, the revenue officers pointed out
various documents for example the masavi, the field book etc.
to justify their stand that the suit land was comprised in Khasra
No.405.

On 26.5.2006 the Deputy Chief Legal Advisor

recommended that an appeal should be filed. On 1.6.2006 the
Chief Law Officer concurred.

Unfortunately, by this summer

vacations had set in. The file which was sent to the counsel for
filing the appeal on 16.6.2006 was addressed to by the counsel
after the courts re-opened after summer recess. He noted on
15.7.2006 that he would be filing the appeal. Thereafter, time
was consumed in drafting the appeal and allied applications. As
noted above, the appeal was filed on 31.7.2006.
15.

A perusal of the record, briefly noted above, shows

that senior officers of DDA were taking a conscious decision
whether there was evidence on record to sustain a challenge to
the decision of the learned Trial Judge.
16.

I an glad to note that no mechanical decision was

taken. The file shows a participative and an interactive mind
at each stage.

The file shows that the concerned officer

required the subordinate staff to satisfy him that a case was
made out for filing an appeal.
FAO No.429/07

This bona fide exercise was
page 6 of 8

ultimately to the benefit of the plaintiff for the reason if the
revenue officers could not have justified their stand, the
competent authority would not have sanctioned the filing of
the appeal.
17.

The record of DDA shows a desire, at each stage, to

prosecute the appellate remedy.
18.

I hold that the delay is bona fide, occasioned by the

desire of a public servant to satisfy himself with reference to
the relevant record that indeed a case was made out to file an
appeal.
19.

Delay caused to the opposite party can always be

recompensed with costs.
20.

I thus dispose of the instant petition setting aside

the impugned order dated 13.10.2006 passed by the learned
Appellate Judge. I allow application filed by DDA under Section
5 of the Limitation Act by imposing costs in sum of Rs.5000/-.
Delay in filing the appeal is condoned.
21.

On costs being paid in Court on the next date of

hearing to learned counsel for the respondents, the appeal
would be restored and would be heard in accordance with law
for the reason delay in filing the appeal stands condoned.
22.

Parties are directed to appear before the learned

Appellate Judge on 12.5.2008.
FAO No.429/07

On said date costs would be

tendered. A formal application may be filed by the appellant a
week prior to 12.05.2008 so that on 12.5.2008 the appeal is
retrieved from the record room and placed before the learned
Judge.
23.

It is hoped and expected that the learned Appellate

Judge would try and dispose of the appeal as expeditiously as
possible for the reason 2 years time has been consumed on
preliminaries.
24.

Copy of this order be supplied dasti to learned

counsel for the petitioner.
