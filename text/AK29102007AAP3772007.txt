1.

The notice of the petition was sent to the respondent.

The

notice was served at the Delhi address of the respondent, however, no
one is present on behalf of respondent. The matter was passed over,
however, no one has appeared even after the pass over and
consequently the respondent is proceeded ex parte.

2.

This is a petition under Section 11(6) of Arbitration &

Conciliation Act, 1996 for appointment of an Arbitrator in terms of
AA No.377/2007

Page 1 of 7

arbitration agreement between the parties.

3.

The petitioner contended that it is a company duly registered

under the Companies Act and is engaged in the business of
manufacture of Stainless Steel Billets etc. Mr.Subhash C. Kathuria is
stated to be the Director of the company authorized to sign, verify and
institute the proceedings on behalf of petitioner pursuant to the Board
Resolution dated 13th August, 2007, a copy of which is filed with the
petition.

4.

According to the petitioner, in order to safeguard and protect

the factory, plant and machinery and the stocks lying therein against
Standard Fire and Specific Perils, the petitioner entered into an
agreement of insurance and took a policy on 19th May, 2005 for
different amounts: for plant and machinery for Rs.10.00 crores; for
stocks for Rs.8.00 crores and for building including boundary wall for
Rs.3.00 crores. The policy was for the period from 20th May, 2005 to
19th May, 2006.

5.

According to the petitioner, the premium as agreed between the

parties was paid. On 18th August, 2005, during the subsistence of the
agreement of insurance between the petitioner and the respondent, a
fire took place at 5.30 AM causing immense loss to the factory, plant

and machinery and stock lying there.

6.

According to the petitioner, it intimated to the respondent and

lodged a claim for Rs.85,19,652/- and also submitted all the relevant
documents along with its claim.

Against the total claim of

Rs.85,19,652/, the respondent have allowed a claim of Rs.8,03,072/only and disputes have arisen between the petitioner and the
respondent regarding quantum of amount of claims. There is an
arbitration agreement between the parties which is as under:“13. If any dispute or different shall arise as to the
quantum to be paid under this policy (liability being
otherwise admitted) such difference shall independently of
all other questions be referred to the decision of a sole
arbitrator to be appointed in writing by the parties to or if
they cannot agree upon a single arbitrator within 30 days
of any party invoking arbitration, the same shall be
referred to a panel of three arbitrators, comprising of two
arbitrators, one to be appointed by each of the parties to
the dispute/difference and the third arbitrator to be
appointed by such two arbitrators and arbitration shall be
conducted under and in accordance with the provisions of
the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.
It is clearly agreed and understood that no
difference or dispute shall be referable to arbitration as
herein before provided, if the Company has disputed or
not accepted liability under or in respect of this policy.
It is hereby expressly stipulated and declared that it
shall be condition precedent to any right of action or suit
upon
this
policy
that
the
award
by
such
arbitrator/arbitrators of the amount of the loss or damage
shall be first obtained.”

Consequent to the arbitration agreement between the parties

and disputes having arisen between the parties, the petitioner sought
appointment of an Arbitrator by a notice dated 17th March, 2007 in
terms of arbitration agreement between the parties. The names of the
proposed arbitrators were also suggested. This notice was duly served
as in the reply dated 12th April 2007 it was stated that notice dated
17th March 2007 from Advocate Manu Bansal of the petitioner was
received on 21st March 2007. The respondent in its reply to notice
suggested the name of another person as sole arbitrator and did not
agree to appoint a sole arbitrator out of the names suggested by the
petitioner.

There

was

no

consensus

between

the

parties

for

appointment of a single arbitrator. Thus by letter dated 30th May,
2005 the petitioner appointed its arbitrator and called upon the
respondent to appoint a second arbitrator in terms of the arbitration
clause. The respondent by letter dated 30th May 2007, however,
refused to appoint any arbitrator on the premise that the claim of the
petitioner has been settled in full and final and therefore the
arbitration agreement cannot be invoked.

8.

The dispute whether the amount of the petitioner's claim has

been settled fully or not is to be decided by the arbitrator.

The

dispute raised by the petitioner is covered under the arbitration
agreement and therefore, the respondent ought to have appointed an

AA No.377/2007

arbitrator before the filing of the present petition.

9.

A learned Single Judge in Haryana Telecom Ltd. v. Union of

India & Anr., 112 (2004) DLT 339=2004 (3) RAJ 147, had held that if
the respondent fails to appoint an Arbitrator within the stipulated
time of 30 days of the notice, and even after filing of the petition
under Section 11 of the Act, it is for the Court to appoint an
Arbitrator. A Division Bench of this Court in Delkon (India) Pvt. Ltd.
v. G.M., Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd., 120 (2005) DLT 542 (DB),
relying on Datar Switchgears Ltd Vs Tata Finance Ltd has held in
para 4 as under:
“4. We have given our careful consideration to the
arguments advanced by learned Counsel for both the
parties. In view of the law laid down in the case of Datar
Switchgears Ltd. v. Tata Finance Ltd. & Anr., IV (2000)
CLT 191 (SC)=VII (2000) SLT 543=JT 2000 (Suppl. 2) SC
226 it is no more res integra that the vacancy can be
supplied by a party pursuant to the arbitration agreement
even after thirty days of the receipt of the notice.
However, once a party approaches the Court and files a
petition for appointment by the designated authority of
the Chief Justice of that Court under Section 11(6) of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, the right to supply
vacancy by the opposite party is extinguished. If that
right stood extinguished on filing of the petition under
Section 11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, in
September 1998 the appointment of an Arbitrator on 3rd
May, 1999 could not be made, therefore in our view, the
order passed by the learned Single Judge on 7th May,
1999 suffers from patent illegality. Therefore, the
submission of the respondent that the petitioner had
appeared before the Arbitrator and the application of the
petitioner raising preliminary objections is pending
adjudication which inter alia challenges the jurisdiction of
the Arbitrator to decide the dispute is of no consequence
AA No.377/2007

Page 5 of 7

as from the order reproduced above it was pursuant to
the directions passed by the learned Single Judge that
the parties were directed to appear before the Arbitrator.
The petitioner had no other option but to appear before
the Arbitrator and after appearing before the Arbitrator
the petitioner has not submitted to the jurisdiction of the
Arbitrator, rather has at first opportunity taken the
objection that the Arbitrator had no jurisdiction to
proceed with the matter.
10.

In Union of India v. M/s. R.R. Industries, 120 (2005) DLT 572

(DB) also it was held that once a party does not supply the vacancy or
fails to supply the vacancy before filing of a petition under Section
11(6) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, such a party forfeits the
right to supply the vacancy in terms of the arbitration clause and
what remains is only the arbitration clause, i.e. the dispute has to be
resolved under the mechanism of alternative dispute redressal
scheme but no right survives to the respondent to supply the named
Arbitrator in the arbitration clause.

11.

Despite the service of the notice, no one has appeared on behalf

of respondent neither any reply has been filed to the petition nor an
arbitrator has been appointed by the respondent before filing of this
petition and therefore, the respondent has lost its right to appoint an
arbitrator and it is for this court to appoint an arbitrator. Since the
arbitration agreement also contemplates appointment of a sole
arbitrator in the first instance, therefore, it will be just and
appropriate to appoint a sole arbitrator to adjudicate the disputes

Arbitrator forthwith. The parties are also directed to give a copy of this
order to the arbitrator. Copies of this order be given to the counsel for
