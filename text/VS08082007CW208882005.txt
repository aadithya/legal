time,

the Rules which governed his appointment were known as

Junior Field Officer Recruitment Rules, 1972 (hereinafter referred to
as JFO Rules 1972).
4.

There were two categories of Junior Field Officers. Some

discharging the duties in the Marketing Wing and other in Carpet
Wing.

Petitioner was in the Carpet Wing.

On 15.2.1978, the

respondents issued orders re-designating the post of those who were
working in the Carpet Wing as Carpet Training Officers (CTOs) and
their pay scale was also fixed at Rs. 550-800.

Other officers who

were in the Marketing Wing their designation remained as Junior Field
Officer. On 4th June, 1979 another order was passed re-designating
the post of Junior Field Officer as Handicraft Promotion Officer (HPOs).
Thus, the two different designations were given to the officers
appointed as Junior Field Officer, namely, CTOs and HPOs.
5.

In the year 1979 itself, the President of India also framed

separate Rules for the CTOs and HPOs under Article 309 of the
Constitution of India. In so far as HPOs are concerned, Rule dated 7 th
April, 1979 came into effect was published in the gazette dated May
12, 1979 and the Rules in the All India Handicrafts Board (Handicraft
Promotion Officers) Recruitment Rules, 1979 were

framed, in

supersession of All India Handicraft Board(Junior Field Officer)
Recruitment Rules, 1972.

For CTOs rules which were framed are

called All India Handicrafts Board (Carpet Training Officer, Carpet

Rule, 1979.
6.

As noted above, in case of CTOs, after their re-designation

as such vide order dated 15th February, 1978, their pay scale was also
fixed at Rs.550-800,

since these officers who were appointed as

Junior Field Officer before the re-designation were enjoying the pay
scale of Rs.550-900. Many of these officers filed O.A. before Central
Administrative Tribunal, Principal Bench, New Delhi raising grievance
against the reduction in the pay scale.

This was allowed by the

Principal Bench vide its order dated 4.2.2002 directing the restoration
of pay scale of Rs.550-900 to the officers who were appointed before
the promulgation of CTO Rules. Some other similarly situated officers
filed similar O.A. in Allahabad Bench of the Central Administrative
Tribunal and following the judgment of the Principal Bench of Central
Administrative Tribunal the said OAs were also allowed by the
Allahabad Bench. Writ petition filed against the order before the High
Court of Allahabad was also dismissed on 8.11.2002.
7.

The effect of the aforesaid judgment was to restore pay

scale of CTOs who were originally appointed as Junior Field Officer
under JFO Rules 1972 so far so good.
8.

The petitioner herein, however, felt aggrieved against the

promotion

orders

dated

27.5.2004

passed

in

respect

of

the

respondent nos. 5 & 7. By the said order respondent nos. 5 & 7 were

WP(C) No. 20888/2005

Page 3 of 6

promoted as Assistant Directors (Handicraft).

Petitioner states that

he was senior to them and said order of promotion in respect of the
respondent nos. 5 & 7 be quashed and direction be given to promote
him as Assistant Director. With the prayer, the petitioner filed O.A.
No. 1731/2004.

The Trial Court has rejected this O.A. and in our

opinion rightly so.
9.

Respondent nos. 5 & 7 were the HPOs. They belong to

different cadre.

It is obvious that after the re-designation of those

JFOs who were working in Carpet Wing Centre as Carpet Training
Officer and subsequently those working in Marketing Wing as HPOs
and framing of different Rules for both these officers under Article
309 of the Constitution,

the cadre of Junior Field Officers was

bifurcated into two categories, i.e., HPOs and CTOs.

Further

promotions of these officers are to be governed by their respective
Rules.

In fact, the pay scale of CTOs at entry level is Rs.550-800.

Since the petitioner was appointed in the scale of Rs. 550-900, the
Tribunal in the aforesaid judgment protected the said pay scale.
However, all those persons recruited as CTOs as per Rules with effect
from 1.9.1979 are placed in the pay scale of Rs.550-800. Therefore,
the petitioner cannot make any grievance when officers belonging to
HPOs get promotion in their cadre as petitioner belongs to different
cadre altogether being CTO.
10.

We may also mention that even this aspect has come for

consideration before the Principal Bench in the aforesaid O.A.173/93
decided on 4.2.2002 as well as before the Allahabad bench in R.P.
Mishra's case. Following observations made in the latter judgment
are quoted and extracted by the learned Tribunal in the impugned
judgment which would have relevance to determine the question at
hand:“11. We have considered the submissions of the
learned counsel for the parties and perused records.
Principal Bench of this Tribunal has already resolved
the controversy by its order dated 4.2.2002 in OA
No. 173 of 1993. The Principal Bench of this Tribunal
in para 5 of the order dated 4.2.2002 has observed
as under :“In so far as the extension to applicants of
the benefits granted to S./Shri Sehgal
Suryanarayana and Jana are concerned,
they were appointed as JFOs under
Marketing Scheme and were later redesignated as Handicrafts Promotion
Officers. Respondents in their reply have
stated that the JFOs in Marketing Scheme
later
re-designated
as
Handicrafts
Promotion Officer form a separate cadre
from JFOs in Carpet Training Scheme, later
designated as Carpet Training Officer. It is
also stated by respondents that there is no
common seniority list among the two sects
of Officers, and the seniority list in respect
of CTOs have been held valid by CAT
Principal Bench in OA No.275/85 and
judgment dated 11.4.1997 in which names
of present applicants occupy various
places. No cogent materials have been
furnished by applicants to rebut the
aforesaid
averments.
Under
the
circumstances, the applicants cannot
claim to be identically placed as S./Shri
Sehgal Suryanarayana and Jana and are
therefore not entitled to the relied granted

to them.” (emphasis supplied)
Even Allahabad High Court, while affirming the aforesaid

view of the Tribunal made the following observations :“1. Petitioner and some other were engaged as Junior
Field Officer in the year 1973-74. Subsequently this
cadre was divided into two separate cadres i.e.
Carpet Training Officer (CTO) and Handicraft
Promotion Officer (HPO). The promotion in cadre
HPO was swifter than the CTO cadre. The petitioner
filed an application before the Central Administrative
Tribunal claiming parity with them. This application
was disposed of on 9.2.1993 with the observation
that the respondents may consider the upgradation
of the posts. Some adjustments were made however,
the cadre of CTO is not similar to that of HPO. The
petitioners again filed original application before the
Tribunal. This has been dismissed on 16th April,
2002. Hence the present writ petition.

12.

2. We have heard counsel for the petitioner and Sri
Shashank Sekhar Sigh, counsels for the contesting
respondents.
Two different cadres have been
created in the year 1979 namely CTO and HPO. The
person of one cadre cannot claim parity with other.
There is no merit on the writ petitioner.
It is
dismissed.” (emphasis supplied)
We are in agreement with the aforesaid view taken by the

Allahabad High Court.

Consequently, the present petition which is

devoid of any merit is hereby dismissed.
