No.5 in the complaint lodged by the respondent under Section
18(a)(i) read with Section 27(c), Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940
seeks quashing of the summoning order dated 18.12.2003.
2.

known as Erythromycin Estolate Oral Suspension USP (60 ml),

Hospital in the presence of the proprietor of the hospital.
3.

On 21.9.2000, one sealed sample portion of the said drug

was forwarded to the Government Analyst, Central Indian
Pharmacopocia Laboratoray, Ghaziabad, U.P.
4.

On analysis the sample of the drug was found to be not of

standard quality.
5.

The manufacturing firm in its letter dated 7.11.2001

stated that it did not accept the Government Analyst's report
and intend to adduce evidence in controversion of Government
Analyst's report as provided under Section 25(3) of the Act and
requested that sample be sent to Central Drugs Laboratory,
Kolkata for re-testing.
6.

On re-testing by Central Drugs Laboratory, Kolkata,

sample was again declared to be not of standard quality.
7.

Investigation conducted by the complainant revealed that

the said drug was manufactured by M/s. Biodeal Laboratories
for M/s. Rhone-Poulene (India) Ltd.

Investigation further

revealed that pursuant to orders of the Hon'ble High Court of
Bombay, on 27.9.2001, M/s.

Rhone-Poulene (India) Ltd. was

amalgamated with Nicholas Piramal India Ltd.
8.

On completion of the investigation, complainant lodged a

complaint with the learned Metropolitan Magistrate impleading
following persons as accused :-

Vide order dated 18.12.03, learned MM summoned
the accused persons to face trial in the complaint. Same reads
as under:
“8.12.2003
Present:

DI in person

I have heard DI/Complainant in person and have
perused the record. I take cognizance of the offence.
Since the Complainant is public servant his
statement is dispensed with. Issue summons of the
complaint to the accused persons for 3.5.2004.
MM, Delhi
8.12.2003”
9.

Learned senior counsel for the petitioner submitted

that the summoning order is based on non-application of
Page 3 of 8

judicial mind by the learned Metropolitan Magistrate. He further
submitted that learned Metropolitan Magistrate failed to note
that M/s. Rhone-Poulene (India) Ltd. and Nicholas Piramal India
Ltd.

are

two

different

companies.

That

the

effect

of

amalgamation between the 2 companies is that M/s.RhonePoulene (India) Ltd. is no longer in existence. That since the
offence was committed by M/s. Rhone-Poulene (India) Ltd.
(transferor company), petitioner which is an entity seperate
from transferor company cannot be prosecuted for the said
offence.
10.

Per contra, learned counsel for the State contended

that petitioner is liable to be tried for the offence as it has
taken over all the assets and liabilities of the firm M/s.RhonePoulene (India) Ltd. In support of his contention, counsel relied
upon clause 8 of scheme of arrangement between the 2
companies. Said clause reads as under:“8.

nature by or against RPIL, NFL (except in
relation to the assets and liabilities specified in
Schedule A to the Scheme) and SPL pending
and/or arising on or before the Effective Date

defined), including the assets and liabilities
referred to in 3.1 and 3.2 hereof, shall neither

same shall be continued and be enforced by

A company which has complied with the

requirement relating to incorporation of companies contained
in Companies Act is a legal entity separate and distinct from
the individual members of the company as held by the House
of Lords in Salomon vs. Salomon & Co.Ltd. (1895-1899) All
England Reports 33.

In

Re:

Walker's

Settlement (1935) 1 Ch.D.567, 'amalgamation' was defined as
under:-

13.

“The word 'amalgamation' has no definite legal
meaning. It contemplates a state of things
under which 2 companies are so joined as to
form a third entity or one company is absorbed
into and blended with another company.”
In the decision reported as Nokes vs. Doncaster

(1940) 3 All E.R. 549, it was held that a contract of personal
service previously existing between an individual and the
transferor

company,

does

not

automatically

becomes

a

contract between the individual and the transferee company.
With reference to Section 154 of the English Companies Act
1929, it was opined as under:“Section 154 contemplates – or, at any rate,
provide for – the dissolution of the transferor
company when the transfer of its undertaking
has been made, and there appears to be no
means of calling back to life the company so

14.

dissolved.”
In the decision reported as In Re: Skinner (1958) 3

All E.R. 273, it was opined as under:-

15.

“.................schemes and orders made by virtue
of Section 206 and Section 208 of the
Companies Act 1948 can only transfer such
rights, powers, duties and property as are
capable of being lawfully transferred by a party
to the scheme if no such sections of the
Companies Act existed. It is not necessary in a
scheme to exclude specifically from its
operation things incapable of such transfer as
general words in the scheme and any order in
furtherance must be taken to operate in a
manner not to repugnant to the general law of
England.”
In the decision reported as Oklahoma Natural Gas

Co. vs. State of Oklahoma 273 US 257 (1927), Supreme Court
of United States observed as under:“There is no specific provision in our rules for
the substitution as a party litigant of a
successor to a dissolved corporation. It is well
settled that a common law and in the federal
jurisdiction a corporation which is being
dissolved is as if it did not exit, and the result of
the dissolution cannot be distinguished from
the death of the natural person in its effect.
................. It follows, therefore, that as the
death of natural person abates all pending
litigation to which the corporation is appearing
either as a plaintiff or defendant. To allow
actions to continue would be to continue the
existence of the corporation pro hac vice. But
corporations exist for specific purposes, and
only by legislative act, so that if the life of the
corporation is to continue even only for
litigating purposes it is necessary that there
should be some statutory authority for the
prolongation.
16.

In the decision reported as American Exch. Bank vs.
Page 6 of 8

Mitchell, 179 III. App.612, 615, 616, it was held that after a
corporation is dissolved, it is incapable of maintaining an
action; and that all such actions pending at the time of
dissolution abate, in the absence of a statute to the contrary.
17.

Appliances Co. Ltd. vs. M.A.Khader (dead) by LR's (1986) 2 SCC

companies

was

It was held that

after the amalgamation of the 2 companies the transferor
company ceases to have any entity and the amalgamated
company acquires a new status and it is not possible to treat
the two companies as partners or jointly liable in respect of
their liabilities and assets.
18.

In para 6 of the decision reported as Saraswati

Industrial Syndicate Ltd. vs. CIT, Haryana, H.P. & Delhi, AIR
1991 SC 70, Supreme Court observed as under:“The true effect and character of the
amalgamation largely depends on the terms
and scheme of merger but there can be any
doubt that when 2 companies amalgamate and
merge into one the transferor company loses its
entity as it ceases to have its business.
However, their respective rights or liabilities are
determined under the scheme of amalgamation
but the corporate entity of the transferor
company ceases to exist with effect from the
date the amalgamation is made effective.”
19.

The legal position which emerges from afore-noted

Page 7 of 8

judicial decisions is that upon an amalgamation between two
companies, the transferor company dies a civil death and the
entity which has evolved upon amalgamation cannot be
prosecuted for an offence committed by the transferor
company. To the same effect are the observations of the High
Court of Himachal Pradesh in the unreported decision in Crl.
Rev. No. 150/1994 M/s. Brooke Bond Lipton (India) Ltd. & Anr.
Vs. State of H.P. & Anr. decided on 24.3.1995.

The clause does not contemplate that criminal

liability for offence committed by the earlier company would be
transferable to the petitioner company.
21.

Noting that the petitioner company came into

picture on 27.9.2001, after the date of manufacture of the said
drug in year 2000, I hold that it cannot be prosecuted for the
said offence.
22.

Order dated 18.12.2003 summoning the petitioner

to face trial in the complaint in question is quashed.

No costs.
