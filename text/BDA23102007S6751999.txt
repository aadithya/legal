BADAR DURREZ AHMED, J
1.

Three interesting questions arise for consideration in these

applications. They are:(1) Whether a merging company, upon merger with
another company and thereby ceasing to exist as an
independent entity, could be construed as having
“died” upon such merger in the context of Order 22 of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908?

IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.1 of 25

(2) If yes, would a suit filed by the transferor company
abate in case no application for bringing its legal
representatives on record is filed within the stipulated
time in view of the provisions of Order 22 Rule 3 of the
Code of Civil Procedure, 1908?
(3) Whether the transferee company, after the merger
referred to above, would be entitled to file an
application under Order 22 Rule 10 of the Code of
Civil Procedure, 1908 and seek substitution in place of
of the transferor company as a plaintiff in a suit?
The Facts:
2.

The facts which give rise to these questions are few. The

present suit was filed by Bank Kreiss AG, a company incorporated in
Germany. The suit was filed on 02.03.1999.

During the pendency of

the suit Bank Kreiss AG merged with and into Yapi Kredi Bank AG.
The merger deed was executed on 27.08.2001 and became effective on
09.10.2001. By virtue of the merger Yapi Kredi Bank AG took over all
the assets and liabilities of Bank Kreiss AG and as such on and from
09.10.2001, the plaintiff ( Bank Kreiss AG) ceased to exist.

On

08.08.2003, the defendant No.4 filed the application (IA 8275/2003) for
dismissal of the suit on account of the non-existence of the plaintiff. All
the other defendants support this application. They submit that as the

IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.2 of 25

plaintiff ceased to exist on 09.10.2001 and no application under Order 22
Rule 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as
'the CPC') was made, the suit has abated.

More specifically they state

and submit that on 09.10.2001 the plaintiff ( Bank Kreiss AG) ceased to
exist as an independent entity.

This meant that the plaintiff died.

Consequently, an application ought to have been made for substituting
the legal representatives of the “deceased” plaintiff within the time
stipulated. The period prescribed under Article 120 in the Schedule to
the Limitation Act, 1963 to have the legal representative of a deceased
plaintiff made as a party, is 90 days from the date of death of the
plaintiff. Therefore, an application for making the legal representative of
the plaintiff a party could have been filed within 90 days of 09.10.2001,
that is, by 07.01.2002. No such application has been filed in the present
case and, therefore, according to the defendants the suit abated on
07.01.2002 and an order of formal dismissal of the suit as having abated
needs to be passed.

3.

After the said application (IA 8275/2003) was filed on behalf

of the defendant No.4, Yapi Kredi Bank AG filed an application (IA
8670/2003) for substitution under Order 22 Rule 10 for leave of the
Court to continue the suit in its name. This application was filed on
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.3 of 25

11.08.2003 after the application filed by the defendants for dismissal of
the suit on the ground that it had abated.

Yapi Kredi Bank AG

contended in the application that by virtue of the merger deed, it has
taken over all the assets and liabilities of the plaintiff and is the successor
in interest of the plaintiff. Consequently, all the interests and rights of
the plaintiff now vest with the applicant and, therefore, the applicant is
competent to continue this suit in place of the plaintiff ( Bank Kreiss
AG).

Questions 1 & 2 : Discussion and Conclusion.
4.

The first issue that has to be examined in this case is whether

the merger of Bank Kreiss AG with and into Yapi Kredi Bank AG meant
that Bank Kreiss AG ceased to exist or died for the purposes of Order 22
Rule 3 CPC, which prescribes the procedure in case of death of one or
several plaintiffs or of the sole plaintiff. Sub- Rule (1) of Rule 3 of
Order 22, inter alia, stipulates that where a sole plaintiff dies and the
right to sue survives, the Court, on an application made in that behalf,
shall cause the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff to be made a
party and shall proceed with the suit. Sub-Rule (2) of Rule 3 of Order 22
CPC provides that where, within the time limited by law, no application
is made under sub-Rule (1) the suit shall abate so far as the deceased
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.4 of 25

plaintiff is concerned. It goes on to provide that if an application is made
by the defendant, the Court may even award costs which he may have
incurred in defending the suit, to be recovered from the estate of the
deceased plaintiff.

Clearly, on the death of a sole plaintiff, if no

application is made for bringing on record the legal representative of the
deceased plaintiff within the stipulated time, then the suit shall
mandatorily abate. Had the present plaintiff been a person in flesh and
blood and had he died on 09.10.2001 then, if no application for bringing
on record the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff had been
made prior to 07.01.2002, the suit would have abated on its own. The
difficulty that arises in the present case is because the plaintiff was a
corporate entity or in other words, a juristic person and not a natural
person. There is no difficulty with the term “death” when applies to a
natural person. But, what is meant by death in the context of a company
needs to be examined.

According to the learned counsel for the

defendants, the moment a company ceases to exist by virtue of
dissolution consequent upon winding up or by virtue of having merged
into another entity, it would mean that the company died.

Several

decisions were cited on both sides on this and other aspects of the matter.
Before I examine those decisions, it would be necessary to note that
Order 22 Rule 3 CPC has no reference to the word “person” or
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.5 of 25

“persons”. The reference is only to the plaintiff/ plaintiffs. However, a
reading of Order 1 Rule 1 CPC would make it clear that a plaintiff has to
be a person. Therefore, it is safe to assume that the expressions plaintiff
or plaintiffs refers to person or persons who institute the suit. Section 3
(42) of the General Clauses Act, 1897 provides that in the said Act, and
in all central acts and regulations made after the commencement of the
said Act, unless there is anything repugnant in the subject or context,
inter alia, “person” shall include any company or association or body of
individuals, whether incorporated or not. Thus, a company would also
be regarded as a person unless such meaning is repugnant to the context
of the statute.

5.

In Narendra Bahadur Tandon v. Shankar Lal : (1980) 2

SCC 253, the Supreme Court observed that “Once the company was
dissolved it ceased to exist and the liquidator could not represent a nonexisting company.” In Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd. v. C.I.T.
Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Delhi: AIR 1991 SC 70, the Supreme
Court considered the question of amalgamation and as to what was the
effect on the amalgamating company. The question arose in the context
of an amalgamation between Indian Sugar and General Engineering
Corporation and Saraswati Industrial Syndicate. The said Indian Sugar
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.6 of 25

company was amalgamated with Saraswati Industrial Syndicate and after
the amalgamation, the Indian Sugar Company lost its identity, as it did
not carry on any business. The specific question before the Supreme
Court was with regard to taxability under Section 41(1) of the Income
Tax Act, 1961. In order to attract the provisions of Section 41(1) for
enforcing the tax liability, it was necessary that the identity of the
assessee in the previous year and the subsequent year was the same. If
there is any change in the identity of the assessee there would be no tax
liability under the provisions of Section 41 of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
The question before the Supreme Court was whether on the
amalgamation of the Indian Sugar Company with Sarswati Industrial
Syndicate, the Indian Sugar Company continue to have its identity and
was alive for the purposes of Section 41(1) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.
Under the scheme of amalgamation the Indian Sugar Company stood
dissolved on 29.10.2002 and ceased to be in existence thereafter. It is in
this context that the Supreme Court observed as under:“5.
Generally, where only one Company is
involved in change and the rights of the share holders
and creditors are varied, it amounts to reconstruction or
reorganisation or scheme of arrangement. In
amalgamation two or more companies are fused into
one by merger or by taking over by another.
Reconstruction or amalgamation has no precise legal
meaning. The amalgamation is a blending of two or
more existing undertakings into one undertaking, the
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.7 of 25

share holders of each blending Company become
substantially the share holders in the Company which is
to carry on the blended undertakings. There may be
amalgamation either by the transfer of two or more
undertakings to a new Company, or by the transfer of
one or more undertakings to an existing Company.
Strictly ‘amalgamation’ does not cover the mere
acquisition by a Company of the share capital of other
Company which remains in existence and continues its
undertaking but the context in which the term is used
may show that it is intended to include such an
acquisition. See Halsbury’s Laws of England 4th
Edition Vol. 7 Para 1539. Two companies may join to
form a new Company, but there may be absorption or
blending of one by the other, both amount to
amalgamation. When two companies are merged and
are so joined, as to form a third Company or one is
absorbed into one or blended with another, the
amalgamating Company loses its entity.
6.
..............The High Court was in error in
holding that even after amalgamation of two companies,
the transferor Company did not become nonexistent
instead it continued its entity in a blended form with the
appellant Company. The High Court's view that on
amalgamation there is no complete destruction of
corporate personality of the transferor Company instead
there is a blending of the corporate personality of one
with another corporate body and it continues as such
with the other is not sustainable in law. The true effect
and character of the amalgamation largely depends on
the terms of the scheme of merger. But there can be any
doubt that when two companies amalgamate and merge
into one the transferor Company loses its entity as it
ceases to have its business. However, their respective
rights or liabilities are determined under the scheme of
amalgamation but the corporate entity of the transferor
Company ceases to exist with effect from the date the
amalgamation is made effective.”
(underlining added)

IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.8 of 25

In Singer India Ltd. v. Chander Mohan Chadha & Ors: (2004) 7 SCC
1, the Supreme Court, following the aforesaid decision in Saraswati
Industrial Syndicate Ltd. (supra), held as under:“ 8. In Saraswati Industrial Undertaking v. CIT
Haryana1 (para 6) it has been held that there can be no
doubt that when two companies amalgamate and merge
into one, the Transferor Company loses its identity as it
ceases to have its business. However, their respective
rights or liabilities are determined under the scheme of
amalgamation, but the corporate identity of the
Transferor Company ceases to exist with effect from the
date the amalgamation is made effective. Therefore, in
view of the settled legal position, the original lessee,
namely, the American Company ceased to exist with
effect from the Appointed Day i.e. 1.1.1982 and
thereafter the Indian Company came in possession and is
in occupation of the premises in dispute.”
6.

After examining these decisions of the Supreme Court it is

absolutely clear that when two companies merge into one, the transferor
company loses its identity as it ceases to have its business. Although the
respective rights or liabilities are determined under the scheme or deed of
amalgamation or merger, but the corporate entity of the transferor
company ceases to exist with effect from the date the amalgamation or
merger is made effective. In the present case the deed of merger was
executed on 27.08.2001 but the merger itself became effective on
09.10.2001. By virtue of the said merger, Bank Kreiss AG, being the
1 1990 Supp SCC 675: AIR 1991 SC 70
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.9 of 25

transferor company did not have any surviving corporate identity on and
from 09.10.2001. It ceased to exist. This effectively meant the death of
Bank Kreiss AG. Since Bank Kreiss AG was the sole plaintiff in the
present suit it meant the death of the sole plaintiff and, therefore, the
provisions of Order 22 Rule 3 became immediately attracted. Since the
right to sue would survive, the suit did not abate on 09.10.2001 itself but
would abate on the expiration of a period of 90 days from 09.10.2001, in
case no application was filed for bringing on record the legal
representative in place of Bank Kreiss AG. The factual position is that
no such application was made within 90 days and, therefore, by the
operation of the provisions of Order 22 Rule 3 (2) CPC, the suit abated
on 07.01.2002. As a result of this discussion, the answers to the first two
questions are: yes and yes.
Question 3:
7.

This takes me to the discussion of the third question.

Generally speaking the transferee company would be entitled to file an
application under Order 22 Rule 10 CPC so as to continue the suit. But,
that would depend on the stage at which such an application is made. If
the application is made before the suit abates, it would be maintainable.
On the other hand, if it is made after the suit has abated, it would not be
maintainable. The provisions of Order 22 Rule 10 CPC apply only if
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.10 of 25

there is a pending suit which can be continued. This will be clear from
the discussion which follows. In the context of this case, the question, in
essence is — whether the application under Order 22 Rule 10 filed on
behalf of the Yapi Kredi Bank AG on 11.08.2003 would be
maintainable? It was contended on behalf of the applicants that the
provisions of Order 22 Rule 10 CPC are clearly applicable. Reliance
was placed on the following decisions:(1)

Dhurandhar Prasad Singh v. Jai Prakash
University & Ors: (2001) 6 SCC 534.

(2)

Sheela Wanti v. Kuldeep Singh & Anr.:
2002(64) DRJ 635.

In Dhurandhar Prasad Singh (supra) the Supreme Court considered the
provisions of Order 22 and in particular Rule 10 thereof in the following
words:“6.
In order to appreciate the points involved, it
would be necessary to refer to the provisions of Order
22 of the Code, Rules 3 and 4 whereof prescribe
procedure in case of devolution of interest on the death
of a party to a suit. Under these Rules, if a party dies and
right to sue survives, the Court on an application made
in that behalf is required to substitute legal
representatives of the deceased party for proceeding
with a suit but if such an application is not filed within
the time prescribed by law, the suit shall abate so far as
the deceased party is concerned. Rule 7 deals with the
case of creation of an interest in a husband on marriage
and Rule 8 deals withe case of assignment on the
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.11 of 25

insolvency of a plaintiff. Rule 10 provides for cases of
assignment, creation and devolution of interest during
the pendency of a suit other than those referred to in the
foregoing Rules and is based on the principle that the
trial of a suit cannot be brought to an end merely
because the interest of a party in the subject matter of
suit has devolved upon another during its pendency but
such a suit may be continued with the leave of the Court
by or against the person upon whom such interest has
devolved. But, if no such a step is taken, the suit may be
continued with the original party and the person upon
whom the interest has devolved will be bound by and
can have the benefit of the decree, as the case may be,
unless it is shown in a properly constituted proceeding
that the original party being no longer interested in the
proceeding did not vigorously prosecute or colluded
with the adversary resulting in decision adverse to the
party upon whom interest had devolved. The Legislature
while enacting Rules 3, 4 and 10 has made clear-cut
distinction. In cases covered by Rules 3 and 4, if right to
sue survives and no application for bringing legal
representatives of a deceased party is filed within the
time prescribed, there is automatic abatement of the suit
and procedure has been prescribed for setting aside
abatement under Rule 9 on the grounds postulated
therein. In cases covered by Rule 10, the Legislature has
not prescribed any such procedure in the event of failure
to apply for leave of the court to continue the
proceeding by or against the person upon whom interest
has devolved during the pendency of a suit which shows
that the Legislature was conscious of this eventuality
and yet has not prescribed that failure would entail
dismissal of the suit as it was intended that the
proceeding would continue by or against the original
party although he ceased to have any interest in the
subject of dispute in the event of failure to apply for
leave to continue by or against the person upon whom
the interest has devolved for bringing him on the record.
7.
Under Rule 10 Order 22 of the Code, when
there has been a devolution of interest during the
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.12 of 25

pendency of a suit, the suit may, by leave of the Court,
be continued by or against persons upon whom such
interest has devolved and this entitles, the person who
has acquired an interest in the subject matter of the
litigation by an assignment or creation or devolution of
interest pendente lite or suitor or any other person
interested, to apply to the Court for leave to continue the
suit. But it does not follow that it is obligatory upon
them to do so. If a party does not ask for leave, he takes
the obvious risk that the suit may not be properly
conducted by the Plaintiff on record, and yet, as pointed
out by their Lordships of the Judicial Committee in Moti
Lal v. Karab-ud-Din2 , he will be bound by the result of
the litigation even though he is not represented at the
hearing unless it is shown that the litigation was not
properly conducted by the original party or he colluded
with the adversary. It is also plain that if the person who
has acquired an interest by devolution, obtains leave to
carry on the suit, the suit in his hands is not a new suit,
for, as Lord Kingsdown of the Judicial Committee said
in Prannath v. Rookea Begum3, a cause of action is not
prolonged by mere transfer of the title. It is the old suit
carried on at his instance and he is bound by all
proceedings up to the stage when he obtains leave to
carry on the proceedings.”
From the above observations several things become clear. In the cases of
assignment, creation or devolution of interest during the pendency of a
suit referred to in Rule 10 of Order 22 CPC, the original party, that is,
the assigner or the one who creates or from whom the interest devolves
continues to exist (to be alive) even after such assignment, creation or
devolution of interest. This is clear from the observation that if the
person on whom the interest has been assigned or devolved upon, has the
2 ILR (1898) 25 Cal 179: 24 IA 170: 1 CWN 639 (PC)
3 (1857-60) 7 MIA 323
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.13 of 25

option of continuing the suit with the leave of the Court or of letting the
original plaintiff continue the same. But in the latter eventuality, the
person on whom the interest had devolved would be bound by and can
have the benefit of the decree unless it is shown in a properly constituted
proceeding that the original party did not vigorously prosecute or collude
with the adversary resulting in a decision adverse to the party upon
whom the interest had devolved. The Supreme Court also made it clear
that in cases covered under Rules 3 and 4, if right to sue survives and no
application for bringing the legal representatives of a deceased party was
filed within the prescribed time, there is an automatic abatement of the
suit and procedure for setting aside such abatement is provided under
Rule 9 of Order 22 CPC on the grounds postulated therein. Therefore,
there is a distinction between Rules 3 and 4 on the one hand and Rule 10
on the other. Rule 3 applies in a case where there is a death of a plaintiff.
Rule 10, on the other hand, applies where in the “lifetime” of the plaintiff
an assignment, creation or devolution of the plaintiff's interest on
somebody else takes place during the pendency of a suit and the plaintiff
continues to be alive and in existence even after such assignment,
creation or devolution. However, the moment the recorded plaintiff dies,
the clock for abatement starts ticking and can only be stopped by either
moving an application for substituting the legal representatives in place
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.14 of 25

of the deceased plaintiff or by resulting in abatement itself on the expiry
of 90 days from the death of the plaintiff, in case no such application is
made. Therefore, this decision of the Supreme Court in the case of
Dhurandhar Prasad Singh (supra) does not in any way advance the
case of the applicant (Yapi Kredi Bank AG).

8.

The next case which was relied upon by the applicant was that

of a learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of Sheela Wanti
(supra). Reliance was placed on the observations contained in paragraph
5 thereof which reads as under:“5.
Before adverting to the merits of the
application under consideration this Court must make
it clear that a substitution under Order 22 Rule 3 of
the CPC and a substitution under Rule 10 of Order 22
CPC stand on altogether different footing and operate
in different fields. A substitution under Order 22 Rule
3 of the CPC is to bring on record the LRs of a
deceased plaintiff in whose favour the right to sue
survives whereas Rule 10 covers the cases in which by
way of assignment, creation or devolution of interest,
during the pendency of the suit, a person has acquired
a right in suit property and as such prays that he may
be substituted in place of plaintiff. Rule 10 of Order
22 CPC does not prescribe any limitation for the
impleadment of a person upon whom the interest in
the property has devolved and as such at any time
during the pendency of the suit he may be substituted.
In Ghafoor Ahmad Khan v. Bashir Ahmad Khan,
AIR 1983 SC 123, the Supreme Court set aside the
orders upholding abatement of an appeal for the
reason that during the life time of the sole respondent/
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.15 of 25

plaintiff, there was a transfer of the property by way
of gift to his wife/applicant and the case being a case
of devolution of interest was falling under Rule 10 of
Order 22 of the CPC and as such there was no
question of abatement. Rule 9 of Order 22 of CPC
permits setting aside of abatement or dismissal upon
an application of an assignor also who might have
acquired interest as defined in Rule 10 Order 22 CPC.
Therefore upon the application of an assignor even the
abatement or dismissal can be set aside and the suit
may be revived.”
On first impressions, this case appeared to support the contentions of the
applicant (Yapi Kredi Bank AG). But, examining the facts, I find that
the same is clearly distinguishable.

In Sheela Wanti (supra), the

application was one under Order 22 Rules 9 and 10 read with Section
151 CPC and Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 for setting aside the
abatement, condoning the delay, if any, in filing of the application and
substituting the applicant in place of the deceased plaintiff in that suit.
Whereas the application in the present case has been filed under Order
22 Rule 10 CPC. There is no application for setting aside the abatement
nor is there any application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963
for condoning the delay in moving such an application. In that case the
suit had abated. Even an order had been passed by the Court that the suit
had abated. Shortly after abatement order had been passed by the Court,
the applicant therein had, within 15 days, moved an application under
Order 22 Rule 10 read with Section 151 CPC. That application was
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.16 of 25

withdrawn with liberty to file a fresh application as it did not contain any
prayer for setting aside the abatement. The fresh application was also
moved within 15 days of the withdrawal of the first application and it is
in this context that the learned Single Judge was of the view that the
applications were filed promptly after the abatement orders. The facts in
the present case are entirely different and, therefore, the decision in
Sheela Wanti (supra) would not be of any assistance to the applicant
herein.

9.

The learned counsel for the applicant had referred to

Government of Orissa v. Ashok Transport Agency & Ors.: (2002) 9
SCC 28. But that was not a judgment of the Supreme Court. There was
a difference of opinion between the two judges which constituted the
Bench and, therefore, the matter was referred to a larger Bench. The
larger Bench decision is reported in Government of Orissa v. Ashok
Transport Agency & Ors.: (2005) 1 SCC 536. That decision would also
be of no help to the applicant inasmuch as the amalgamation, which was
considered in that case, was a statutory amalgamation and Clause 7 of the
amalgamation order itself made specific provision with regard to
continuance of legal proceedings. It is only on the basis of the said
Clause 7 that the Supreme Court observed that any suit, prosecution,
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.17 of 25

appeal or other legal proceedings by or against the dissolved company
pending on the appointed day, shall not abate or be discontinued or be in
any way prejudicially affected by reason of the transfer to the resulting
company, the corporation, of the undertaking of the dissolved company
or of any thing contained in the amalgamation order. However, while
construing the special provision made in Clause 7 of the amalgamation
order, the Supreme Court made observations as to what would have
normally been the case had there been no such special provision. The
Supreme Court observed as under:“8.
Normally, in a case covered by Order 22 Rule 10
of the Code of Civil Procedure where rights are derived by
an assignee or a successor-in-interest pending a litigation, it
is for that assignee or transferee to come on record if it so
chooses and to defend the suit. It is equally open to the
assignee to trust its assignor to defend the suit properly, but
with the consequence that any decree against the assignor
will be binding on it and would be enforceable against it.
Equally, in terms of Section 146 of the Code of Civil
Procedure, a proceeding could be taken against any person
claiming under the defendant or the judgment debtor.
Similarly, a person claiming under the defendant or the
judgment debtor could seek to challenge the decree or order
that may be passed against the defendant by way of appeal
or otherwise, in the appropriate manner. But, it would not
be open to it to challenge the decree as void or
unenforceable in execution in the absence of any specific
provision in that regard in the statute or order bringing
about such a transfer or assignment. Going by these general
principles, it is possible to argue that it was for the
Corporation, and subsequently for the State of Orissa, to get
themselves impleaded in the suit and to prosecute a
defence, not inconsistent with the defence already set up by
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.18 of 25

the defendant in its written statement. Neither the
Corporation nor the Government of Orissa took that step. In
such a situation, normally, one would be inclined to the
view that it is not open to the Corporation or to the
Government of Orissa to challenge the executability of the
decree as against them. It is in this context that the impact
of Amalgamation Order has to be considered.”
As would be clear from a plain reading of the above observations, there
is nothing therein which would go to help the present applicant.

10.

Order 22 Rule 10 requires further consideration. It reads as

under:“Order XXII
10. Procedure in case of assignment before final order
in suit.—
(1)
In other cases of an assignment, creation or
devolution of any interest during the pendency of a suit, the
suit may, by leave of the Court, be continued by or against
the person to or upon whom such interest has come or
devolved.”
The expression “the suit may, by leave of the Court, be continued” is of
great importance and significance. Leave of the Court can be taken by
the person to or upon whom the interest referred to in the said provision
has come or devolved for continuing a suit by or against such person.
For this provision to be applicable, there must be a pending suit. It is
only a pending suit which can be continued. A suit which has abated

IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.19 of 25

cannot be continued. Therefore, an application under Order 22 Rule 10
would not lie in a suit which has abated and is no longer pending. The
abatement of a suit can be set aside as indicated in Rule 9 (2) of Order 22
CPC on the grounds indicated therein.

But unless and until the

abatement is set aside, no application under Order 22 Rule 10 would be
maintainable because such an application is only for the purposes of
continuing the suit and not for the purposes of reviving a suit which has
abated. In this context three decisions referred to and relied upon by the
defendants are of material significance.

The first decision is of a

Division Bench of the Calcutta High Court in the case of Kedarnath
Kanoria and Ors. v. Khaitan Sons and Co.: AIR 1959 Calcutta 368.
Two separate but concurring opinions were given by R. S. Bachawat, J.
and K. C. Das Gupta, C. J. The following observations in the opinion of
Bachawat, J. are noteworthy:“ 20
Regarding this case as a case of
assignment simpliciter, it is well settled since the
decision in Rai Charan vs Biswa Nath, 20 Cal LJ
107: (AIR 1915 Cal 103, that the suit is not arrested
by reason of the assignment, that the assignee may, if
he chooses, obtain leave of the Court under Order
XXII, Rule 10, but if he does not do so, the original
assignor plaintiff is entitled to continue the suit and
the assignee will be bound by the result of the
litigation. Dealing with a case where the assignor
plaintiff was allowed to continue the suit in spite of
the assignment of the debt which was the subjectmatter of the suit, Das, C.J. pointed out in
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.20 of 25

Jugalkishore Saraf vs Messrs. Raw Cotton Co.Ltd.,
(AIR 1955 SC 376 at p.394), that in the eye of the
law the position of the assignor, vis a vis assignee
was nothing more than that of benamdar for the
assignee and that when the decree was passed for the
recovery of the debt it was the assignee who was the
real owner of the decree. Of course where both the
assignor and the assignee are parties to the suit, the
decree cannot be passed in favour of the assignor and
must be passed in favour of the assignee and such a
case is dealt with by Lord Porter in Monghibai vs
Cooverji Umersey, LR 66 I.A. 210 at 220 = AIR
1939 PC 170 at p.173.
21
In my opinion, the absence of an
application under Order 22, rule 3 in due time after
the death of the sole plaintiff on the record will cause
the suit to abate, though the deceased plaintiff may
have parted with his interest in the subject-matter of
the suit before his death.”
“25
It is true that the death of the assignor
plaintiff simpliciter does not take away the right of
the assignee to apply under Order XXII, rule 10 of
the Code of Civil Procedure. By Order XXII, rule 1
the death of the plaintiff of itself does not cause the
suit to abate. Before the suit has abated the assignee
may apply for and obtain leave to continue the suit.
He may also, if he chooses, apply for substitution of
the legal representative of the deceased plaintiff. In a
proper case the order for leave to continue the suit
may be dated nunc pro tunc as of the date when the
application was made. If necessary, the application
for leave to continue the suit may be treated as being
in substance a composite application for substitution
of the legal representatives of the deceased plaintiff
and thereafter of the applicant. On obtaining the
necessary leave the assignee becomes the new
plaintiff and the suit cannot thereafter abate on
account of the death of the original plaintiff.
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

26
But the assignee can obtain leave only to
continue a suit. If the suit has already abated, there is
no suit which may be continued. The abatement
terminates the suit and disposes of the plaintiff's
claim as if the suit has been dismissed without a
hearing. Leave to continue a suit cannot be given
after the suit has terminated. It cannot be given if the
suit has already been decreed or dismissed for default
of appearance of the plaintiff. Similarly, leave cannot
be given if the suit has already abated. The suit
abates automatically in the absence of any application
under Order XXII, rule 3 within ninety days and a
further order declaring that the suit has abated is not
necessary. The assignee is bound by the abatement
and by proceedings had in the suit before his
intervention.”
In the concurring opinion of K. C. Das Gupta, C. J, it was observed as
under:“38.
Is it possible however to give such
permission to continue the suit under the provisions of
Order XXII, rule 10 of the Code of Civil Procedure
even where the suit has abated? It seems to me a
contradiction in terms to say that the person on whom
the interest has devolved is given leave to continue the
suit after the suit has ceased to exist. Something which
has ceased to exist cannot be allowed to continue and
wide though the powers of the court be, and should be,
in the interests of justice I am unable to persuade myself
that a suit which has abated can be allowed to be
continued.”
11.

The second decision is of a full Bench of the Kerala High

Court in the case of Goutami Devi v. Madhavan Sivarajan: AIR 1977
Kerala 83 (FB). The relevant observations are as under:IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.22 of 25

“ 3.
The question therefore is, whether despite
the failure of the legal representative to seek to come
on record on the death of the appellant an assignee
from such appellant could move for being impleaded
under Order XXII, Rule 10 of the C.P.C at a time
when the proceedings must be taken to have abated
under Order XXII rule 3 (2) of the CPC against the
legal representative.”
“5.
... If no application is made within the time
provided for making such an application under law the
suit shall abate in so far as the deceased plaintiff is
concerned.”
“7.
... It seems to us to be plain from the
scheme of Order XXII that an assignee can make an
application for leave to continue the suit so long as
there is a suit, so far it concerns the assignee, on the
file of the court. In a suit which is not subsisting,
there is no scope for seeking continuance. It is only
logical that in a case where the suit has abated, the
assignee cannot thereafter seek to be added as a party
to the action. That this is the scheme is evident from
an examination of the Order XXII of the Code of Civil
Procedure.”
“10.
... This does not mean that the suit
nevertheless survives in regard to the interest of the
deceased so as to enable the assignee to seek to be
impleaded.”
12.

The third decision is of the Patna High Court in the case of

Devkinandan Lal v. Jogendra Prasad & Ors: AIR 1980 Patna 71. The
relevant observations are as under:“4
In this application the only point that was
raised by the petitioner, was that in view of the
IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.23 of 25

provisions of O.22, R 10 of the Civil P.C. the
petitioner being an assignee of the interest of the
original plaintiff, ought to have been permitted to
continue the suit instituted by Narsingh Lal since there
was no period of limitation for an application under
Order 22, Rule 10 of the Civil P.C. There is no doubt
that if it is a case which can be said to be covered by
the provisions of Order 22, Rule 10 there will be no
question of limitation nor would it require going into
any evidence with regard to the sufficiency of the
cause shown. But in my view, the argument of Mr.
Sinha proceeds upon an inherent fallacy.
The
provisions of Order 22, Rule 10 of the Civil P.C can
apply to the facts of a particular case only where any
of the previous Rules is not applicable. The effect of
any other rule prior to Rule 10 of Order 22 cannot be
got rid of by a resort to this rule. It is also well settled
that where there are two devolutions of interest,
namely, one by death of a party covered by the
provisions of Rule 3 and 4 of Order 22 and the other
by transfer of his interest prior to his death, the
transferee has a right to be impleaded under Order 22,
Rule 10, and the mere death of the party concerned
cannot take away this right. That is so, because there
is no abatement under Order 22, Rule 10. But the
position is entirely different where the suit has already
abated on the death of the assignor plaintiff. In such
an event, if once the suit has abated, the assignee
cannot continue the suit under Order 22, Rule 10 of
the Civil P.C. inasmuch as there is no suit pending to
be continued at the instance of the assignee. A suit
having abated, there is nothing for the assignee to
continue. That is the precise scope of Rules 3, 4 and
10 of Order 22 read conjointly........... ”
Conclusion:
13.

The position, therefore, is clear that Order 22 Rule 10 CPC

cannot apply in a situation where the suit has abated. And, as observed

IA No.8275/2003&8670/2003 in CSOS 675/99

Page No.24 of 25

by K. C. Das Gupta, C.J in

Kedarnath Kanoria (supra) it is a

contradiction in terms to say that the person on whom the interest has
devolved is given leave to continue the suit after the suit has ceased to
exist. Since I have already held that the suit abated after 90 days of the
date on which the merger became effective, the application under Order
22 Rule 10 filed on behalf of the applicant (Yapi Kredi Bank AG ) much
after the said abatement is not maintainable. It is perhaps open to Yapi
Kredi Bank AG to apply for setting aside the abatement under Order 22
Rule 9 (2) CPC, accompanied by an application for condonation of delay.
But no such applications have been filed by the applicant and unless and
until the suit is pending or the abatement is set aside, no application
under Order 22 Rule 10 CPC can be entertained. Consequently, IA
8275/2003 is allowed and IA 8670/2003 is dismissed.
