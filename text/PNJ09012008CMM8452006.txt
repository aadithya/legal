PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.

1.

Heard.

2.

Petitioner is aggrieved by the order dated 27.4.2006

passed by the learned Additional District Judge, Delhi in RCA
No.38/2003, an appeal against an order passed under Section
47(a) of the Indian Stamp Act requiring petitioner to pay the
requisite stamp duty treating the value of the subject property
at Rs.7,82,000/-.
3.

The Collector of Stamps had determined the value
Page 1 of 4

of the property as under :“A. Value of land @ 50% of Rs.8360 per sq. mtr. the
L & DO Rate of M.B.Road Locality notified upto the
year 2000 and comes as Rs.4,180/- x 84 sq. mtrs. is
Rs.3,51,120/B.
10% cost increased for the years 2000-2002 on
Rs.3,51,120/- which comes to
Rs.3,86,232/C.
Cost of construction @ Rs.385/- x 900 sq. fts.
comes to
Rs.3,46,500/D.
Total value of the property in question i.e. B+C
above is
Rs.7,32,732/-”
4.

Inter alia, in the appeal, petitioner had specifically

pleaded

that

the

subject

property

RZ-78,

Gali

No.10,

Tughlakabad Extension was built on land comprised in Khasra
No.499, Tughlakabad Extension.

That the area came up on

undeveloped land. It was pleaded that the colony Tughlakabad
Extension was an unauthorized colony till it was regularized on
23.9.1983. It was specifically pleaded that the locality having
come up as an illegal colony was devoid of facilities such as
sewage, drain, parking etc.

It

was

specifically

pleaded in

appeal that land rates notified by L & DO pertaining to regular
colonies developed on government land by governmental

Page 2 of 4

agencies could not form the yardstick to determine the land
rate of the subject property.
registered

by

the

Various sale deeds which were

Sub-Registrar,

Delhi

pertaining

to

Tughlakabad Extension were relied upon as proof of the value
of property in Tughlakabad Extension.
5.

The impugned order dated 27.4.2006 does not

consider the submissions made in appeal. I find no mention in
the impugned order as to what would be the effect of subject
land being situate in a colony which was unauthorized but was
subsequently regularized. I find no mention in the impugned
order as to how the colony Tughlakabad Extension is similar
and comparable with colonies developed by L&DO. I find no
mention in the impugned order as to why registered sale deeds
in Tughlakabad Extension would not constitute good evidence
to determine the value of property in Tughlakabad Extension.
6.

Suffice would it be to state that in relation to value

of land, land rates notified by the government are mere
evidence, but similarity and comparability is the sine qua non
before applying rates so notified while determining the value of
a particular property.
7.

The petition stands disposed

of quashing the

impugned order dated 27.4.2006 in RCA No.38/2003.
8.

The appeal is restored. Learned Additional District
Page 3 of 4

Judge would re-decide the appeal in accordance with law and
keeping in view the observations in the present order.
9.

No costs.
