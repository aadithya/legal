from the date of petition till realisation.
4.

Brief facts of this case are that on 16.7.1993, at about

12.30 p.m., the appellant was walking on foot alongwith
one Sh. Sunil Kumar on extreme left hand side of
Nagafgarh Road near Silvania Factory, Moti Nagar, Delhi.
In the meanwhile, a bus bearing No. DL-IP-0076 driven by
respondent No. 1 in a rash and negligence manner and at a
very fast speed, came from Shadipur side and struck
against the appellant and his companion.

Due to this

impact, the appellant and his companion fell down on the
road and the wheel of the bus passed over the right leg of
the appellant. The bus in question is owned by respondent
No. 2 and was not insured.
5.

The grievance of the appellant is that Tribunal erred

in assessing the monthly earning loss of the appellant at Rs.
200/- only on the basis of 10% permanent disability,
whereas appellant

suffered from permanent disability to

the tune of 25% and Tribunal should have assessed the
monthly financial loss to the tune of Rs. 500/-.
6.

Secondly, the Tribunal ought to have applied the

multiplier of 35 years as appellant was 23 years of age at
FAO No. 377/1997

Page 3 of 8

the time of accident.

For pain & agony, a sum of Rs.

5,000/- has only been awarded. Since appellant remained in
the hospital for about two months and thereafter visited for
one year as OPD patient. So, keeping in view the nature of
injuries and continuous treatment, the Tribunal should
have awarded Rs. 50,000/- on this count.

On account of

medicines, Rs. 10,000/- should have been awarded and
similarly for special diet, appellant spent Rs. 12,000/- but
the Tribunal awarded Rs. 5,000/- only.

No compensation

was awarded for availing the service of the attendant and
for conveyance, appellant was awarded Rs. 2,500/- only.
Lastly, interest of 6% only was awarded. However, keeping
in view the various judgments of the High Courts on this
point, the Tribunal ought to have granted 24% interest.
7.

Appellant was doing private service and his monthly

income was Rs. 2,000/- per month. PW-2, the employer of
appellant

stated that appellant was getting Rs. 2,000 per

month as salary and other perks and he remained absent
from his duty for about one year.

The learned Tribunal

accepted the salary of appellant as 2,000/- per month and
since appellant remained absent from duty for one year, it
FAO No. 377/1997

Page 4 of 8

granted him full compensation for the loss of his earning
i.e. Rs. 24,000/-.
8.

Regarding expenses incurred on treatment/purchase

of medicines, appellant stated that he has spent Rs.
10,000/- on medicines, but he could not retain all the Bills
and proved some of them, which are Exhibit PW5/2 to 31.
Total of these Bills, come to Rs. 1,154/-.

The appellant

remained admitted in Ram Manohar Lohia, hospital which
is a Govt. Hospital and as such his treatment was free of
charge. In spite of this, the Tribunal awarded Rs. 5,000/towards

expenses

incurred

on

treatment/purchase

of

medicines. This amount of Rs. 5,000/- awarded by learned
Tribunal is quite reasonable.
9.

With regard to conveyance, appellant has stated that

after his discharge from the hospital, he has been visiting
the hospital as an outdoor patient, once in a week and had
gone in taxi for about 6-7 times. He used to spend Rs. 200/per visit on taxi and thereafter, he used to visit hospital in
auto rikshaw and has visited about 20 times, spending Rs
100/- per visit.
10.

The learned Tribunal has granted a sum of Rs.2,500/-

FAO No. 377/1997

Page 5 of 8

on account of conveyance to the appellant which in my
opinion, is quite sufficient.
11.

With regard to the special diet, appellant stated that

he took special diet for one year and spent Rs. 12,00013,000/-. There is nothing on record to show as to what
special diet was prescribed by the doctor.

However, the

learned Tribunal awarded Rs. 5,000/- on account of special
diet, which is quite reasonable.
12.

Now, coming to the permanent disability, appellant

has placed on record copy of disability certificate Exhibit â€“
PW 5/3.

The learned Tribunal observed that the appellant

has failed to examine the doctor who has given him the
disability certificate so that the permanent disability of the
appellant in relation to whole of his body could be
measured.

Since the certificate has been granted for

giving benefit to handicapped persons and describes the
injury as 25% with regard to the right limb, the Tribunal
opined that the permanent disability suffered by the
appellant with respect to the whole body could not be more
than 10%. As the appellant was earning Rs. 2,000/- per
month and keeping in view the disability suffered by him in
FAO No. 377/1997

Page 6 of 8

the accident, his earning capacity has been reduced to 10%
say Rs. 200/- per month. So, keeping in view the age of the
appellant, the learned Tribunal adopted a multiplier of 16
years to arrive at compensation on account of permanent
disability.
13.

The multiplier of 16 adopted in this case is quite

justified and

keeping in view the various decisions of the

Apex Court on this point, sum of Rs. 38,400/- is quite
reasonable.
14.

Lastly, the Tribunal awarded Rs. 5,000/- towards pain

and agony suffered by the appellant. This amount is also
quite reasonable, keeping in view the injuries sustained by
the appellant.
15.

With regard to the interest of 6% p.a. awarded by

learned Tribunal, it is reasonable, keeping in view, the rate
of inflation.
16.

Looking from any angle, I do not find that the

compensation awarded by the learned Tribunal in this case
was not just. Since the compensation awarded by learned
Tribunal is just and sufficient, no ground is made out for
enhancement of the compensation and as such there is no

merit in this appeal and same is hereby dismissed.

No

order as to costs.
