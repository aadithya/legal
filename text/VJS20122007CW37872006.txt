VIKRAMAJIT SEN, J.
JUDGMENT
1.

A spate of applications have been filed in the

interregnum between the initiation and culmination of the
election process to the Board of Directors of the Supreme
Court Bar Association Multi State Group Housing Society.
The law on this question is well-settled, having withstood
all assaults over half a century.

The Constitution Bench

had in N.P. Ponnuswami -vs- The Returning Officer,

Namakkal Constituency, Namakkal, Salem Distt., AIR (39)
1952 SC 64 observed that the word 'election' takes within
its sweep the entire procedure to be gone through to return
a candidate to the Legislature.

Their Lordships further

opined that law does not contemplate two attacks on
WP(C) No.3787/2006

Page 2 of 6

matters connected with elections, one under Article 226 in
the course of the process of election and the second after
the election is completed. It was clarified that any matter,
which has the effect of vitiating an election, should not be
brought up at an intermediate stage before any Court. This
proposition of law has been reaffirmed and applied by the
Supreme Court in Avtar Singh Hit -vs- Delhi Sikh Gurdwara

Management Committee, (2006) 8 SCC 487. One of us
(Vikramajit Sen, J.) in Avtar Singh Hit -vs- Delhi Sikh

Gurudwara Management Committee, 2006(127) DLT 535
had been greatly impressed by the contention that since
notices had not been issued/received by the Petitioner and
he had consequently been precluded from participating in
the election, the entire election process had become
vitiated.

It was on this premise that the election of the

Members of the Executive Board of the Delhi Sikh
Gurudwara

Management

Committee

had

been

countermanded. This Order was reversed by the Division
Bench whose view was upheld by their Lordships on the
ratio of Ponnuswami.
2.

These applications have been filed at a similar

WP(C) No.3787/2006

Page 3 of 6

intermediate stage in the election process. We have
perused the Report of Shri S.M. Aggarwal, Returning
Officer on the subject of the conduct of the elections of the
Society. Succinctly stated, he was impeded in completing
the counting of the ballots by several members of the
Society. We have carefully perused the said detailed
Report. In our opinion, it will not be appropriate to accede
to

the

requests

made

before

us

by

various

Applicants/Members that the election be countermanded,
and repolling be ordered.

3.

One of the arguments articulated before us is that

persons who have not even paid their subscriptions have
not only been allowed to vote but also to stand for
elections. Although we are of the prima facie opinion that
this may not be in consonance with law or equity, since the
election process has already commenced, we must restrain
ourselves from interfering with its reaching its culmination
point.

4.

We shall forbear from making any observations on the

WP(C) No.3787/2006

Page 4 of 6

submission that some ballot boxes, allegedly misplaced,
may have been interfered or interpolated with. The merits
of such contentions would be

jurally

tested at the

appropriate time.

5.

Shri S.M. Aggarwal, Returning Officer, expressed his

desire to resign. However, we decline to accept the
resignation as, in our opinion, it is imperative that the
counting of the ballot papers should be completed by him
at the earliest.

6.

We direct Shri S.M. Aggarwal, Returning Officer, to

complete the counting of the ballots, which he was in the
process of doing before a disruption was caused.

This

exercise be completed by him within thirty days from today.
Shri S.M. Aggarwal, Returning Officer shall have the
discretion

to

adopt

whatever

procedure

he

finds

appropriate. He shall be free to choose his place of sitting;
to choose his assistants; and to require and obtain police
assistance, if he apprehends this necessity.
7.

Needless to state any Objections which may already

WP(C) No.3787/2006

Page 5 of 6

have been ventilated before us, or may have been
perceived thereafter, may be initiated in accordance with
law. Shri S.M. Aggarwal shall be paid a sum of Rs.25,000/by the Society within fifteen days from today.

After

completing the counting of the ballot papers the ballot
boxes shall be stored with the Registry of the High Court of
Delhi, in a place allocated by the Registrar-General.

8.

Applications are disposed of in these terms.
