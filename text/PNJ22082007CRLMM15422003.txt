PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
Two complaints were filed on 19.2.2002 against the

petitioners. The complaints were for an alleged offence under
Section 62 and 63 of the Companies Act,1956.
2.

One complaint related to stated defaults committed

by the petitioners, disclosed to be the directors of M/s.
H.B.Stock Holding Ltd. when annual return was filed on
28.12.1992.

The second complaint related to the alleged

defaults when annual return was filed on 21.11.1994.
3.

It is not in dispute between the parties that the

offence, if proved to have been committed, would be
punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to
two years. Thus, limitation for filing the complaints would be
three years under Section 468 Cr.P.C. 1973.

It is also the

common case of learned counsel for the parties that in the
facts and circumstances of the instant case limitation would

Crl.M.C. No.1542/03

Page No.2 of 6

commence under Section 469 (1) (b) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure 1973.
4.

The question which needs to be considered is, on

what date limitation commenced.
5.

That takes me to the pleadings in the complaint. It

is stated in the complaint that inspection of the books of
accounts and records of the company was ordered on
26.5.1998. The inspection was completed in August 1998 and
report was submitted to the Registrar of Companies.
6.

If that be so, actionable knowledge would be

attributable to the Registrar of Companies, the person
aggrieved, as held in the report published as 2000 Company
Cases (Vol.101) 271 Registrar of Companies Vs. Rajshree
Sugar & Chemicals Ltd. when the report of inspection listing
the alleged deficiencies was submitted to the Registrar of
Companies. Thus, the complaints ought to have been filed by
August 2001. The complaints have admittedly been filed much
thereafter.

As noted above, complaints have been filed on

19.2.2002.
7.

It was sought to be urged that the Registrar of

Companies is not supposed to rush through the deficiencies
notified to him.
Crl.M.C. No.1542/03

He needs time to consider the nature of
Page No.3 of 6

deficiencies. Further, it is advisable to put the offending party
to prior notice and receive a reply, for if a satisfactory reply is
received, Registrar of Companies may not even file a
complaint.

It is thus urged that time consumed for said

purpose had to be excluded while computing limitation.
Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that such a view
would be beneficial to the accused for otherwise the Registrar
of Companies would be compelled to rush through with the
matter.
8.

The arguments seems attractive at the first blush.

But it has no legs to stand.
9.

Legislature does not intend parties to immediately

rush to court when cause of action accrued. A sufficient period
is given within which matter could be sorted out or further
investigations

could

be

completed.

This

criminal

offence,

is

the

period

prescribing limitation.
10.

In

relation

to

limitation

is

prescribed under Sub Section 2 of Section 468 of the Cr.P.C.
1973. In relation to offence punishable with imprisonment for
a term exceeding 1 year but not exceeding 3 years, the
limitation is 3 years. The 3 years' period is intended to be the
cushion period within which the complainant must decide and
Crl.M.C. No.1542/03

Page No.4 of 6

take recourse to the course which the complainant intends to
charter.
11.

Any other view would mean that a court would have

to read into the statute that the time spent by the complainant
to form a reasonable opinion whether or not to proceed under
the penal law has to be excluded. I am afraid, the statute does
not provide so.
12.

Learned counsel for the respondent has relied upon

a decision dated 25.1.2007 in Crl. M (M) No.3241/2002.
13.

I have perused the decision. On the facts of the said

case, learned Single Judge in para 11 observed that issue of
limitation which was arising was a mixed question of law and
fact.
14.

Instant case is not one where the question of

limitation arises as a mixed question of law and fact.
15.

I thus hold that the complaints are barred by the

limitation.
16.

The petitions are allowed.

17.

Order taking cognizance of the complaints as also

the summoning order are quashed.
18.

No costs.
