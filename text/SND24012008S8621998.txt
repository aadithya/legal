supply of shoes and the plaintiff supplied shoes to the defendants from
time to time.

The plaintiff raised bills for the supplies made by it to

defendants. The plaintiff gave details of invoices numbers, challans with

The plaintiff's case is that

defendants, in discharge of their obligation of paying price for the supplies
so made, had been making payments towards the due amount from time
to time. However, four of the cheques given in discharge of their liability
got dishonoured, the details of which are as under:

recovery of an amount of Rs.11,12,403.90.

In the written statement, defendants took the stand that defendant

was engaged in wholesale of footwears and the plaintiff company
approached him for launching and promoting the sales of its footwears, to
which the defendants agreed. The plaintiff had been supplying footwear to
the defendants and the defendants had also been supplying leather to the
plaintiff. Defendants put in tremendous efforts for promoting the products
of the plaintiff company and in giving feedback to the plaintiff. The
cheques in question were issued by the defendants in favour of the
plaintiff in good faith on a representation made by the plaintiff that it was
in need of some money and advance cheques should be given. This
amount was to be adjusted out of the supplies effected by the plaintiff.
The second contention is that these cheques were to be used by the
plaintiff only to arrange finances from their bankers. However, the
plaintiff, contrary to the understanding, presented these cheques for
encashment. So, the defendants issued instructions to their bankers for
“stop payment”. In the meantime, defendants received large rejection of
the plaintiff's goods and informed the plaintiff about it. Defendants asked
plaintiff to lift the same. The

plaintiff company instead of settling the

accounts and lifting the rejected goods, presented the post dated cheques
although no amount was payable by the defendants to the plaintiff. The
cheques were not issued in acknowledgment of any outstanding liability.
The books of accounts of the plaintiff company were not correct nor had
been maintained in accordance with the regular practice.

The plaintiff

prepared only the extracts to suit to its requirements. The plaintiff had not
given credit of the debit notes issued by the defendants in respect of the
rejected goods. Defendants denied that it was liable to make any
payment rather defendants claimed that it was to recover from the
plaintiff a sum of Rs. 21,70,733/-. The defendants filed counter claim of
Rs.21,70,733.15.
4.

In the replication, plaintiff denied the claim of the defendants and

reiterated its own averments. Plaintiff denied that any supply of leather

was made to it by the defendants.

After framing of issues, the parties were asked to lead evidence.

Plaintiff examined one witness PW-1 Suresh Kumar, who was the manager
of the plaintiff company. This witness was not cross examined by the
defendants despite providing repeated opportunities and imposition of
costs. Ultimately, this Court vide order dated 2nd March 2006 observed
that adequate opportunity has been given to the defendants for cross
examination and since there was no cross examination and defendant did
not avail the same and cross examination was recorded as 'Nil'. The
defendant was given opportunity to examine its own witnesses. The
defendant had filed affidavit of one witness but thereafter did not appear
neither the witness was produced for cross examination. The plaintiff
closed its evidence on 29th March 2006. Since the defendants did not
examine any evidence, the evidence in the case was closed on 24th April,
2006 and the matter was listed for arguments. The defendant did not
appear even at the time of arguments.
ISSUE NO.1
7.

The plaintiff's witness Suresh Kumar in his affidavit dated 8th

November 2005 proved that he was working as Manager in the firm of
plaintiff for the last 15 years and was well conversant with the facts of this
case. The plaint of the case is is signed and verified by Mr. A.K. Bose. PW1

CS(OS) No.862/1998 with Counter Claim No.426/2000

Page No.3 of 5

deposed that Mr. A.K. Bose was authorized by Board of Directors of the
company by resolution dated 30th September 1979 to take legal actions.
He has proved the resolution as Ex.PW1/1. He deposed that Mr. A.K. Bose
was competent to sign on behalf of the plaintiff company. Since the
evidence of plaintiff has gone unrebutted, this issue is decided in favour of
plaintiff and against the defendants.
ISSUE NO.2 & 3
8.

PW-1 by his testimony proved that the plaintiff has been supplying

shoes to the defendants from September 1994 to July 1997. The shoes
were supplied by way of 37 invoices on different dates and challans were
prepared in this respect. All the challans and invoices were collectively
proved as Ex.PW1/2. PW1 also deposed that the challans were duly
received by Mr. Mukesh Bhatia on behalf of the defendant and delivery of
the goods was received by the defendants. The defendant, in the written
statement, has not denied receipt of the goods. The case of the defendant
is that no credit of the rejected material was given to it. Keeping in view
the fact that no cross examination of PW1 was done and there is
admission in the written statement regarding supply of goods by the
plaintiff to the defendant,

the plea of defendant that credit was to be

given is baseless. PW1 also deposed about the dishonour of four cheques
amounting to Rs.6,76,548/-. There is an admission on the part of
defendants to the fact, in the written statement, that these cheques were
got dishonoured. Though the defendant gave an explanation for the same
but the same cannot be considered in absence of evidence of defendant.
All these cheques were from the period 5th December 1996 to 22nd
February 1997. This suit was filed by the plaintiff in April 1998. The
supplies were made by the plaintiff from 1994 to 1997. The amount due
towards the defendants was in respect of the supply of goods
continuously made from 1997 onwards.
9.

A perusal of facts would show that each supply of goods to the

defendants has been of approximately between 1.4 lac to 2.9 lac. The
plaintiff have filed the suit for the recovery of the amount for the supplies
CS(OS) No.862/1998 with Counter Claim No.426/2000

Page No.4 of 5

made between April 1995 and April 1998 i.e. within a period of three
years. It would be seen that the supply made between April 1995 and July
1997 till the trade continued between plaintiff and defendants were more
than Rs. 14 lac. The due amount towards the defendants, as per the case
of the plaintiff, was Rs.10,38,902.70.

There is no rebuttal to this. I

consider that plaintiff is entitled to recover the due amount of
Rs.10,38,902.70 with a reasonable interest. The interest claimed by the
plaintiff in its claim is 21%, which I consider is on higher side. I consider
that the plaintiff is not entitled to interest @ 21% and he is entitled only to
a reasonable rate of interest from the date the plaintiff served notice on
the defendants for payment of this amount, till realization. As per the
version of plaintiff, the notice was served by the plaintiff on the
defendants on 15th November 1997 for payment of this amount. I consider
that plaintiff is entitled to interest over this amount only from 15th
November 1997 at the rate of 10% simple interest till realization. This
issue is decided accordingly.
ISSUE NO.4, 5 & 6
10.

The defendant has failed to lead any evidence qua its counter

claim. The onus of proving counterclaim was on the defendant. The issues
are accordingly decided in favour of plaintiff and against the defendants.
The counter claim of the defendants is hereby dismissed for want of
evidence.
(Relief)
11.

The suit of the plaintiff is decreed for a sum of Rs.10,38,902.70 with

a simple interest @ 10% per annum from 15th November 1997 till
realization. The plaintiff is also entitled to the cost of suit. Decree sheet be
prepared accordingly.
