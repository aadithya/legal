KAILASH GAMBHIR, J. Oral:
*

By way of the present appeal the appellants seek
to challenge the impugned award dated 23.11.2006,
MAC APP. NO. 111/2007

page 1 of 8

whereby

the compensation amount of Rs. 2,84,000/- has

been awarded in favour of the appellants along with
interest @8% p.a. from the date of filing of the petition till
realisation.
The grievance of the appellant in the present
appeal is that the Tribunal has ignored the monthly salary
certificate which was proved on record as Ex.PW1/1.
The brief facts of the case are as under:
On 15.2.2006 at about 5 p.m., the deceased Smt.
Sneh Sharma was crossing

Shankar Road red light near

Hongchi Restaurant towards old Rajender Nagar and when
she reached near the divider of the road, suddenly a Tata
bus

bearing registration No. DL I PA 1835

which was

coming from Ridge Road side being driven by the driver in
rash and negligent manner hit the deceased, consequently
she received fatal injuries and died on the spot.
Counsel for the appellant contends that

the

deceased Smt. Sneh Sharma was employed on the post of
MAC APP. NO. 111/2007

page 2 of 8

Assistant Committee Organizer with the MCD and she was
drawing a salary of Rs.11,900 per month at the relevant
time of the accident.
contends that

Counsel

the appellant

Dharmpal Tyagi, clerk
had categorically

for the appellant further
had examined PW1, Mr.

of the MCD who in his deposition

admitted the employment

of the

deceased with the MCD on the post of Assistant Committee
Organizer. The said

witness

has also proved the salary

certificate of the deceased as Ex. PW1/1, which shows that
the deceased was

drawing monthly emolument of Rs.

11,900/-. Counsel thus contends that
wrongly applied

the Tribunal

the Minimum Wages Act

has

to assess the

income of the deceased when evidence to this effect was
placed on record by the appellant.

Counsel for the

appellant has thus sought to urge that the said evidence
could not have been ignored by the Tribunal and no reasons
have been given in the award also as to why such evidence
has been ignored by the Tribunal. Counsel for the appellant

MAC APP. NO. 111/2007

page 3 of 8

further contends that even PW-2, daughter of the deceased
in her deposition proved the said income of the deceased.
PW-2 in her deposition has stated that the deceased used to
keep Rs. 2000-2500/- for her personal expenses and rest of
the amount she was spending towards the maintenance of
her father.

She further contends that

husband of the

was dependent upon his deceased wife as he

was confined to bed due to the paralysis.
Per contra, Col. S.S. Yadav, counsel for the
respondent contends that husband of the deceased was an
ex-serviceman and was getting pension

and the two

daughters of the deceased were already married. Besides
that,

husband of the

pension of the

was also receiving the

Counsel thus contends that

there is no financial dependency of the legal heirs left by
the deceased and therefore, no fault can be found with the
findings

given

by

the

Tribunal,

assessing

financial

dependency of the appellant to the extent of Rs. 1,44,000/-

MAC APP. NO. 111/2007

page 4 of 8

after applying the multiplier of 8.

Besides awarding

compensation towards loss of financial dependency, the
Tribunal has

also awarded a sum of Rs.1 lac towards

general expenses, keeping in view the paralytic condition of
the husband
awarded

of the deceased.

The Tribunal has also

towards funeral rites.
I have heard the learned counsel for the parties and
have perused the award.
Perusal of the award shows that the Tribunal has
completely ignored the deposition of PW-1 and PW-2 who
had duly proved on record the income of the deceased at
Rs. 11,900/- p.m. Once it has been proved on record that
the deceased was drawing a particular income then there
cannot be any justifiable reason for ignoring such income,
which was

proved on record. I, therefore, do not find any

justification in the finding of the Tribunal, who assessed the

MAC APP. NO. 111/2007

page 5 of 8

income of the deceased on the analogy that she could have
earned a sum of Rs.3,000/-by doing household work like
cooking food, washing clothes etc.

It seems the Tribunal

has passed the said award in a great haste as instead of
taking into account the income proved on record with the
help of salary certificate, it has adopted the analogy of
assessing the income of the deceased on the basis of her
being a household lady.

The findings of the Tribunal are

thus absolutely perverse and illegal. The income of the
deceased after deducting

transport allowance, disability

allowance and medical allowance comes to Rs.11,625/- in
place of Rs.3,000/- as assessed by the Tribunal.

The

deceased is survived by her two married daughters and her
husband, therefore, safely half of the said income can be
taken into account for deducting personal expenses.
multiplier of 8 has been correctly

applied

The

as per the

Second Schedule as the deceased was 55 years of age at
the time of the accident. After applying the said multiplier

loss of financial dependency would come to Rs.5,58,000/-.
The Tribunal has awarded a sum of Rs.1 lac as general
damages without giving any justification for awarding the
said amount.

It appears that due to paralytic condition of

the husband of the deceased the Tribunal has awarded the
said compensation towards general damages.

As the

husband of the deceased is getting monthly pension being
ex-serviceman, and is also

receiving pension of his

deceased wife, there is no justification for grant of general
damages, therefore the same is disallowed.

Taking into

consideration

the monthly income of the deceased, I

enhance

compensation

the

towards

loss

of

financial

dependency to Rs.5,58,000/- from Rs. 1,44,000/-.

The

compensation amount under the other heads would remain
the same.
Since in para 10 of the award, reference has been
made

to the statements of married daughters of the

appellant no.1, the award was directed to be payable only

MAC APP. NO. 111/2007

page 7 of 8

to the husband of the deceased

i.e.,

appellant no.1,

accordingly, differential amount be paid to the

appellant

no.1 by the respondent, along with up-to-date interest
@7.5%p.a. from the date of filing of the petition till
realisation.
With these directions, the appeal stands disposed
of.
