ground that the same has not been filed a person competent

Goel, a Former Judge of this Court. The arbitrator made an
award on 10.01.2003 holding the respondent entitled to a
total sum of Rs.11 lacs representing the principal amount of
Rs. 6,09,512/- towards his fees and interest upto the date of
the award inclusive of cost and stamp duty etc. Interest @
15% per annum on the principal amount of Rs.6,09,512/- was
also awarded to the respondent.

Aggrieved

by

the

said

award, the society filed a petition under Section 34 of the
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 which came to be
registered as OMP No. 142/2003.

An objection to the

maintainability of the said petition on the ground of
competence of Shri Pradeep Mehta to file the same on behalf
of the society appears to have been raised before the learned
Single Judge which found favour with him culminating in the
dismissal of the petition by an order of the learned Single
Judge

dated 28.03.2007.

Aggrieved by the said order the

present appeal has been filed by the appellant society
through Shri H.S. Khan, special power of attorney holder of
the Administrator of the society.
When this matter came up for hearing on 13.08.2007,
the learned counsel for the parties and Shri S.M. Mazumdar,
Administrator of the society who was also present in person

FAO(OS) No. 277/2007

submitted that there were chances of an amicable settlement
between the parties. Since, however, the liability under the
award for the had to be liquidated by the members of the
society, the Administrator desired that the matter could be
adjourned to enable him to convene a General Body Meeting
of the Members to discuss the issue and come up with a
concrete proposal. The appeal was accordingly adjourned to
24.09.2007 to enable the Administrator to convene a meeting
of the members and to make a concrete proposal for an
amicable settlement to the respondent award holder.

On

24.09.2007, the Administrator reported that a meeting of the
General Body of the society had been held on 22.09.2007 in
which the General Body has authorised him to negotiate a
settlement with the respondent.

He further stated that he

was willing to discuss the matter and to negotiate such a
settlement with the respondent for which purpose the appeal
was

adjourned

to

enable

the

parties

to

explore

the

possibilities of a settlement. Mr. Mazumdar, Administrator of
the society today submits that pursuant to the efforts made
by the parties to evolve an amicable settlement, a settlement
has

indeed

been

arrived

at

according

to

which

the

respondent has agreed to receive a sum of Rs.11,20,000/-

only in full and final settlement of all the claims in relation to
agreement between the parties as also the award made by
the Arbitrator inclusive of interest, costs, damages and
expenses whatsoever. The parties have to that effect signed
a document which has been filed before us today by Mr.
Mazumdar and Shri Harsh Narang, one of the partners of the
respondent. Statement of Shri Mazumdar, Administrator of
the society and counsel for the respondent have been
separately recorded in which they have subscribed to the
correctness of the settlement as set out in the document
presented before Court marked Exhibit `ST-1'.
In the light of the above developments and with the
consent of learned counsel for the parties, we allow this
appeal but only in part and to the extent that the award made
by the learned Arbitrator and the order passed by the learned
Single Judge shall stand modified to the extent that the
respondent shall be entitled to recover from the appellant a
total sum of Rs.11,20,000/- only in full and final discharge of
all liabilities under the agreement between the parties, the
award made by the Arbitrator and all claims on account of
professional
