CORAM:
HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE S. RAVINDRA BHAT
ORDER
28.03.2008

Issue notice. Mr. Gupta accepts notice and states that the

matter can be disposed of at this stage.
2.

In this proceeding, under Article 227 of the Constitution of

India the petitioner claims to be aggrieved against the order dated
20.3.2008 whereby the learned Civil Judge declined his application for
interim order to restore the electricity connection in terms of a deposit
already made.
3.

This litigation has somewhat

chequered

history; the

petitioner had filed WP No. 16825-26/2006, being aggrieved by a bill for
the sum of Rs.12,14,111.00 issued by the respondent. That petition was
disposed of by an order dated 29.11.2006. In its terms the petitioner was
permitted to deposit 50% of the bill amount within 12 weeks of which

Rs.2,50,000/-

was to be paid within four weeks.

Subject to the

condition a statement was recorded on behalf of the respondent that it
would proceed against the petitioner under Section 135 r/w Section 154
of the Electricity Act.

The electricity connection was directed to be

continued in those terms.

The petitioner carried the matter in appeal;

the Division Bench issued notice on 2.2.2007 and as an interim measure
reduced the deposit amount to 25%.
4.

By its order dated 17.12.2007, the Division Bench

permitted the petitioner to withdraw the appeal. Thereafter the petitioner
instituted a Suit before the Civil Judge claiming injunctive relief. In the
said proceedings, an application under Order XXXIX Rule 1 & 2 CPC
was moved, by which the petitioner sought an order that electricity
should be continued in terms of the deposit made and to restrain the
respondents from disconnecting the electricity supply to the premises.
5.

The Civil Judge by order dated 1.3.2008 was of the view

that since this court had issued directions for restoration of electricity
supply on deposit of 50% of the impugned bill it lacked jurisdiction to
vary the conditions for restoration and disconnection of the supply of
electricity.
6.

Learned counsel contended that the trial court's view is

palpably erroneous and unsustainable because this court's direction to
make a deposit of 50% of the amount was without going into the facts
of the case and on the basis that the dispute involved examination of
facts.

Counsel submitted that the petitioner has, however, right to

contest the respondent's demand and the trial court has erred in not
examining the case for interim relief on its merit.
7.

Learned counsel for the respondent, on the other hand,

urged that the petitioner has sought to invoke the aid of the Court no
less than four occasions including an appeal to the Division Bench and
also by asking for

clarification of the orders of the court in different

dates including 14.3.2008. It was submitted that in the light of the
peculiar facts the court should refrain from interfering with the order of
the trial court.
8.

The above facts would show that the petitioner's grievance

was entertained in writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution.
The order of 29.11.2006 recorded that in the event of the petitioner
depositing 50% of the demanded amount the respondents would not
disturb the status quo in the sense that they would not dis-connect the
electricity supply.

The petitioner was dissatisfied;

he sought

intervention through an appeal; initially the appellate court reduced the

amount to 25% as an interim measure. However, it later permitted to
withdraw the appeal but consequent of this fact was that the original
order of the court dated 26.11.2006 stood as it stands even today.
9.

This court has considered the impugned order of the Civil

Judge dated 1.3.2008 and 20.3.2008. The learned Judge noticed while
declining the application as follows:“01.03.2008
I am of the opinion that since the
Hon'ble High Court of Delhi vide order dated
29.11.2006 had issued directions for restoration
of the electricity supply on deposit of 50% of the
impugned bill amount, this court has no
jurisdiction/authority to entertain any dispute
pertaining to the terms and conditions for
restoration of the electricity supply/restraining
the disconnection of the restored supply.
Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff has
stated that he has moved a fresh application
before the Hon'ble High Court for clarificatinn of
the order.
I have already held that this court
has no jurisdiction/authority to pass any stay
orders since the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi has
already finally decided the issue vide its order
dated 29.11.2006. The LPA has been dismissed
as withdrawn and the clarification application
was also dismissed.
In these facts and

circumstances
the interim order dated
24.12.2007 of this court stands vacated.
I have been informed by the Ld.
Counsel for the plaintiff that the clarification
application moved by the plaintiff before the
Hon'ble High Court of Delhi would be listed for
hearing on 2/3.03.2008.“
“20.03.2008
No doubt the Hon'ble Division Bench
of the Hon'ble High Court of Delhi vide order
dated 02.02.07 in LPA No. 89/07 directed
restoration of the electricity supply subject to
deposit of 25% of the impugned bill amount.
However, the LPA was dismissed as withdrawn on
17.12.2007 and therefore the interim order passed
in the LPA never attained finality.
The order dated 15.03.2008 was
passed as the Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff had
stated that the application had been allowed by
the Hon'ble High Court. The copy of the order
filed today shows that the application was not
allowed in its entirety. The result is that the order
dated 15.03.2008 is again vacated. The costs
imposed on the defendant on 15.03.2008 are also
waived off and it is further directed that the
plaintiff shall bear the costs of the LC appointed
on 15.03.2008.
Ld. Counsel for the plaintiff requests
that he may be given one more opportunity of

being heard. “
10.

Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that in the

facts of this case this court may pass appropriate orders having regard to
the previous circumstances in which the petitioner was placed and the
spate of litigation faced by the parties. In view of this statement, the
petitioner is directed to pay 10% of the bill amount within four weeks
from today. This will

be in addition to the 25% already deposited.

This will enure and bind the parties till the conclusion of the
proceedings before the trial court.

Subject to

compliance of these

conditions, the respondent shall restore the electricity connection. The
trial Court's order is modified to that extent.
The CM (M) NO. 388/2008 and CM Nos. 4491/08 &
4492/08 are disposed of in the above terms.
