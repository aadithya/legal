PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J. (Oral)

1.

Petitioner is an accused in FIR No.467/04 dated

7.12.2006 P.S. Welcome Colony under Section 186/353/307/34
IPC read with Section 25/27/57/59 of the Arms Act.
2.

Petitioner is named as an accused in the FIR.

It is

recorded in the FIR that secret information was received by the
Duty Officer of P.S. Welcome Colony that at around 7 PM armed
criminals
Seelampur.

would assemble at Jheel Park, Welcome Colony,
Information to said effect was recorded in the

Rojnamcha. A raiding party was organized consisting of a SubInspector, an Assistant Sub-Inspector, 2 Head Constables and 3
Constables.
3.

In vehicle No.DL-1L-D-5051 the raiding party reached

the park in question. One Jamil Ali, resident of House No.42, Gali
No.20, Braham Puri, Seelampur, aged 40 years, agreed to join the
investigation. The raiding party concealed themselves near the
Jheel Park. At around 7.05 PM, 9 persons came on 4 motor cycles
and stationed themselves near the fountain wall of the park. As
the police party moved towards the said persons, they started
firing.

Police retaliated the fire. 7 persons were apprehended

which included the petitioner.

2 out of 9 persons who had

assembled managed to flee.
4.

Alleging false implication, petitioner prays that he be

released on bail.

It is stated that the petitioner is in judicial

custody since 8.12.2004 and that only 6 out of 22 witnesses of
the prosecution have been examined. It is stated that as per the
FIR no weapon
katta

was recovered from the petitioner.

That desi

and live cartridges were recovered from Chander Mohan

and Umesh @ Rahul.
5.

It is urged that Chander Mohan was admitted to bail

by the learned ASJ vide order dated 21.2.2006.

6.

At the outset, it may be noted that contention

of

learned counsel for the petitioner that in the FIR it has not been
recorded that any weapon was recovered from the petitioner is
incorrect.

In the FIR it is categorically recorded that petitioner

was apprehended by Constable Pradeep Kumar along with a desi
katta.
7.

As regards the order granting bail to Chander Mohan, I

note that the learned ASJ has categorically recorded that since
Chander Mohan was not armed with any weapon at the time of
alleged occurrence, case was made out to admit Chander Mohan
to bail. I may further note that the learned ASJ has over looked
the fact that even Chander Mohan was armed with a katta. This
fact has been categorically recorded in the FIR.
8.

In my opinion, where a co-accused has been released

on bail on an incorrect premise, said order cannot be pressed into
aid to seek bail by a co-accused on the ground of parity.
9.

Thus, petitioner would have to stand on his own legs.

10.

The public witness, Jamil Ali, has been partly examined

as PW-1. In his testimony, Jamil Ali has stated that on the day of
occurrence, at around 7 PM, he was going towards Braham Puri
and had reached near the park when some police officers
requested him to be associated in the raid.

He stated that he

was made to sit under a tree at some distance. After some time,
he saw the accused persons present in court firing. The police
surrounded the accused persons. That the accused persons came
on 4 motor cycles but one motor cycle sped away.
persons were

apprehended by the police.

That 7

He stated that he

could not tell who the persons were because it was night.

He

stated that 3 kattas were recovered from the accused persons.
11.

Thus, PW-1, Jamil Ali, has apparently supported the

case of the prosecution.
12.

But, I may note a very disturbing feature.

13.

Jamil

Ali

was

partly

examined

on

15.9.2005.

Thereafter, police officers have been examined as PW-2 to PW-6.
No urgency has been shown by the learned public prosecutor or
the investigating officer to complete the testimony of PW-1.
14.

Till PW-1 is fully examined, it would be inappropriate to

discuss, even for the purpose of prima facie finding, the
incomplete testimony of PW-1.
15.

Petitioner is an accused in 4 other FIRs. The same are

as under:(i)
(ii)
(iii)
(iv)

FIR No.894/2000 u/s 356/379/34 IPC, PS Jahangirpuri.
FIR No.289/03 u/s 308/34 IPC, PS Jahangirpuri.
FIR No.461/04 u/s.394/397/412/120B/34 IPC, PS
Mansarovar Park
FIR No.852/04, u/s.379/411/34 IPC, PS Shalimar Bagh.

16.

In my opinion, it would be inadvisable to release the

petitioner on bail at this stage.
subjected to cross-examination,

Till PW-1 is fully examined and
it

would not be prudent to

release the petitioner on bail who, as noted above, is an accused
in as many as 5 FIRs relating to dacoity, causing grievous injuries
likely to cause death, etc.
17.

Declining the bail to the petitioner I direct the learned

ASJ to ensure that PW-1 is examined on date next after the date
already fixed

for hearing

and examine PW-1

on day to day

basis till his evidence is complete.
18.

I grant liberty to the petitioner to seek fresh bail after

PW-1 is examined.
19.

Subject to directions aforesaid, petition is dismissed.

20.

LCR be returned.
