CORAM:
HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE ARUNA SURESH
(1) Whether reporters of local paper may be
allowed to see the judgment?
(2) To be referred to the reporter or not?
(3) Whether the judgment should be reported
in the Digest ?
ARUNA SURESH, J.
Present application has been filed by defendants
for directing the plaintiff to file proper amended plaint as per
the order of this Court dated 22.4.2003 whereby plaintiff was
allowed to amend his plaint.

2.

Learned counsel for defendants have pointed out

that in para 14 of the plaint, plaintiff has changed the
language of the paragraph by changing the words “copartitioners (actually co-parcener)” to the words “co-

parceners (actual co-parceners)” in the amended plaint.

3.

After comparing the original plaint with the

amended

plaint

it

is

evident

that

plaintiff

has

made

substantial change in para 14 of the amended plaint. I may
mention here that in para 14 of the original plaint it is the
letter addressed to the Commissioner of Income Tax which
has been reproduced.

Whereas in the amended plaint,

plaintiff has changed the words used in the said letter by
substituting

“co-parceners

(actual

co-parceners)”.

Therefore, the plaintiff has not adhered to the order of this
Court while filing the amended plaint.

In Dalu Ram V. Harphool (1998) 1 Punj.L.J.675

4.

it was held that once the Court allows amendment, it does
give right to the applicant to amend pleadings, but strictly in
accordance with the order allowing such amendment .

No

party can have the liberty to introduce a case or amendment
which was not specifically permitted by the Court.

The

plaintiff, therefore, in this case has exceeded the amendment
sought for while filing the amended plaint.

5.

Some material changes have been pointed out in

the replication filed by the plaintiff to the written statement
filed

by

defendants

after

I.A. No.6465/05 in CS(OS) No.1135/97

amendment

of

the

plaint.

Replication is not a part of the pleadings.

Replication is

required to be filed with the permission of the Court, if there
are new points raised by defendants in the written statement
which may need reply.

Plaintiff, therefore, exceeded the

limits of law of pleadings as prescribed under the Code of
Civil Procedure while filing replication containing numerous
new averments or amendments in the replication without any
permission of the Court. This replication to the written
statement to the amended plain cannot be taken into
consideration for any purpose.

6.

Consequently, the application is allowed. Plaintiff

is directed to file fresh amended plaint strictly in accordance
with the orders of this Court dated 22.4.2003. The replication
filed by him to the written statement to the amended plaint
shall not be considered as a part of the pleadings.

The

replication originally filed shall be looked into for all
purposes.
Application is disposed of accordingly.
