1.

This writ petition was initially filed by the petitioner seeking return

of his Passport No.A-3448836 which had been impounded by the respondents.
Subsequently, an amended writ petition was filed wherein the additional prayer
of quashing of the order dated 21.08.2006 passed by the Section Officer,
Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi was sought. The impugned order
dated 21.08.2006 has reference to the petitioner's representation dated
20.02.2006 for release of the seized passport. A copy of the representation is
already on record as it was annexed alongwith the original writ petition. From
the impugned order, it appears that the petitioner's passport facilities had been
WP(C)13184/2006

Page No.1 of 5

refused under Section 6 (2) (i) of the Passports Act, 1967 (hereinafter referred
to as 'the said Act'). The reasons given for such refusal read as under:“1. Making a false statement about loss of passport No.A3448836 issued on 22.7.1997 by PO, Jalandhar before
the Embassy of India, Jakarta to obtain a travel
document (Emergency Certificate) with malafide
intentions;
2. Holding two travel
documents
concurrently
(Emergency Certificate No.653726 dated 28.12.1998
and Passport No.A-3448836 dated 22.7.1997.
3. Suppression of the fact that traveled to India on
30.12.1998 on Emergency Certificate.
4. Your inability to disclose details of travel document
used for travel to Germany.”
2.

The learned counsel for the petitioner, with reference to the

impugned order dated 21.08.2006, straightway pointed out that the provisions
of Section 6(2) (i) of the said Act were clearly inapplicable inasmuch as this
was not a case of refusal of the passport or travel documents. The petitioner
already possessed a passport which had been impounded.

3.

In response to this, the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the

respondents, submitted that a wrong Section has been mentioned and that, in
fact, the passport of the petitioner was impounded under the provisions of
Section 10 (3) (b) of the said Act. This provision specifically authorises a
passport authority to impound or cause to be impounded or revoke the passport
or travel document, if such passport or travel document was obtained by
suppression of material information or on the basis of wrong information
WP(C)13184/2006

Page No.2 of 5

provided by the holder of the passport or travel document or any other person
on his behalf. It is the case of the petitioner that there was no suppression of
any material information on the part of the petitioner which resulted in the
issuance of the passport or the travel document. The case as put forth by the
learned counsel for the petitioner is that on 22.07.1997, the petitioner was
issued the aforesaid passport by the Jalandhar Regional Passports Office and
the said passport was valid upto 21.07.2007. It is stated that in 1998, the
petitioner, after obtaining a valid visa to travel to Indonesia, went to Indonesia.
During his stay in Indonesia, he misplaced his passport. A complaint was
registered for loss of his passport. Although it is stated by the counsel for the
respondents that upon the lodgment of such report, the petitioner was issued an
emergency certificate for return to India, the learned counsel for the petitioner
refutes this statement. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the
petitioner travelled without any passport or emergency certificate from
Indonesia to Germany in 1999 and that he was given political asylum in
Germany. It is further submitted that on 26.08.2005 the petitioner married a
German national, namely, Ms Domling Birgit Charlotti and that on 26.09.2005,
the petitioner, who had, in the meanwhile, found his passport, was granted a
German visa valid upto 01.10.2006 and the same had been affixed on that
passport. It is further contended that the petitioner came to India on 09.12.2005
alongwith his German wife. On 25.01.2006, when the petitioner was returning
to Germany with his wife, he was restrained and his passport was impounded.
WP(C)13184/2006

Page No.3 of 5

According to the petitioner, he was so restrained on the ground that the passport
had been reported lost and a look out circular (LOC) had been issued in this
context and it was because of the LOC (which was still active) that the passport
of the petitioner was impounded and he was restrained form travelling to
Germany. According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, the only fault of
the petitioner is that after he had found his passport, he did not inform the
authorities in India that the passport had been found as a result of which the
look out circular (LOC) was not cancelled and this ultimately resulted in the
impounding of his passport.

4.

He has also impugned the impounding order dated 21.08.2006 in

the amended writ petition inasmuch as the order was passed after he had filed
the writ petition. He also submits that a proper opportunity was not granted to
the petitioner to place the aforesaid facts before the concerned authorities.

5.

The learned counsel for the respondents was also heard and he

made various submissions in support of the impugned order. He firstly stated
that there is no indication as to how the petitioner was able to travel from
Indonesia to Germany without any travel document. He further submitted that
the petitioner has not given any details as to when the passport had been lost
and when it was found by him.

He has also stated that an Emergency

Certificate No.653726 dated 28.12.1998 was issued to the petitioner and that he
WP(C)13184/2006

Page No.4 of 5

travelled to India on that document on 30.12.1998 and there is an endorsement
to that effect. It is the case of the respondents that the petitioner has suppressed
material facts as also the fact that he travelled to India on 30.12.1998 on the
said Emergency Certificate when the original passport was already with him.

6.

Considering the arguments advanced by the counsel for the parties,

I am of the view that since the impugned order had not been passed when the
initial writ petition was filed and that the order itself quotes a wrong section,
i.e., Section 6 (2) (i) of the said Act, when, in fact, the order was issued under
Section 10 (3) (b) of the said Act, the same needs to be set aside. The petitioner
shall now file a fresh representation within a week deeming the impounding of
the passport to have taken place, as indicated above, under the provisions of
Section 10 (3) (b) of the said Act for the reasons indicated in the letter dated
21.08.2006 as well as those indicated above in the submissions made by the
learned counsel for the respondents. The appropriate authority on receipt of
such representation shall dispose of the same within two weeks thereafter in
accordance with law.
This writ petition stands disposed of with these directions.
Dasti.
