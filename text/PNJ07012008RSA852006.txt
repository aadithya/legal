PRADEEP NANDRAJOG, J.
These are cross objections filed by the respondent.

The regular second appeal was dismissed on 20.3.2007. But
unfortunately the cross objections remained pending.
2.

Following question of law needs to be answered with

reference to the cross objections:“Whether the Courts below were justified in ignoring
the rents reflected in Ex. PW-1/28 to Ex. PW-1/30 and
additionally were the Courts justified in not awarding

damages payable, if lessee continued to occupy the
leased premises beyond the period of lease, at 6
times the agreed rent.”
I am concerned with the period 1st May 1997

onwards till appellant vacated the suit property.
4.

Possession has since been with the respondent.

5.

The property in question is the basement and

ground floor of property bearing Municipal No. B-48, South
Extension, Part I, New Delhi.

As per registered lease deed,

Ex.PW-1/1, the property was let out for a period of 5 years. For
the first three years agreed monthly rent was Rs.9,500/-. With
effect from 1.5.95 till 30.4.1997 i.e. date of expiry of the lease,
rent stood enhanced to Rs.10,925/- per month.
6.

Admittedly, the lease clearly stipulates (Vide Clause

VII) that the demise property has been let out for residential
use according to conditions prescribed by DDA and that the
lessee shall abide by the terms of the lease.
7.

The lessee referred to in the lease deed is obviously

the the appellant.
8.

Exhibits PW-1/28 to PW-1/30 are three leases of the

adjoining property B-50, South Extension, Part I, New Delhi.
The three leases are between different owners of different
portions of property No. B-50, South Extension, Part I. But, the
lessee is the same.

9.

The lessee under the three lease agreements is M/s.

Aptex Ltd., a public limited company. The three lease deeds
have been executed on 18.6.1997. The three leases relates to
three different portions on the second floor of the building.
10.

Clause IV 'd' of the three leases is relevant for the

reason it shows that the three portions on the second floor
were let out for a commercial purpose. It reads as under:-

11.

(d) Not to make any structural alteration of a
permanent nature in the Premises as would
permanently damage or destroy the Demised
Premises except those which are necessary for the
Lessee to make in order to carry on its business as
however not to cause any damage to any other
portion of the said building. But the Lessee can erect
and remove temporary/partition walls.”
The Courts below have ignored the rent stipulated in

the lease deeds Ex. PW-1/28 to Ex. PW-1/30 for the reason,
though an adjoining building, letting was for a commercial
purpose.
12.

The respondent has been awarded mesne profits

with effect from 1.5.1997 @ Rs.20,000/- per month.
13.

Reasons given by the Courts below is that the lease

agreement executed in May 1992 was a consent lease and for 3
years agreed rent was Rs.9,500/- per month.

Thereafter,

agreed rent for the next 2 years i.e. May 199 to May 1997 was
Rs.10,925/- per month.

Therefrom, an inference has been

drawn that the rentals increased by about 10% over 2 years.
RSA.No.85/06

Page 3 of 7

Taking cognizance of general increase in rent in Delhi a fair
rental on weighted average basis has been determined at
Rs.20,000/- per month.
14.

It is urged by the respondent that notwithstanding

Ex. PW-1/1 stipulating that the property would be used for a
residential purpose, it was actually used for a commercial
purpose. But, respondent conceded that there was no evidence
led on this aspect of the matter. Second contention urged is
that 6 times agreed rent which was claimed in the suit is not
penal rent. The argument was elaborated with reference to the
lease deeds Ex. PW-1/28 to Ex. PW-1/30. Following judgments
were cited by the respondent to urge that there has been an
increase in rent in Delhi:A.
1999 (2) SCC 325 Martial Sons and Co. Vs. Sahi
Oretrans Pvt. Ltd.
B.
1994 (2) AIR CJ 500 Dr. P.S.Bedi Vs. The Project
and Equipment Corporation Of India.
C.
2005 (1) RCJ 98 (SC) Anderson Wright and Co. Vs.
Amar Nath Raj & Ors.
D.
2005 I AD (SC) 219 M/s. Atma Ram Properties (P)
Ltd. Vs. M/s. Federal Motors Pvt. Ltd.
15.
In respect of the first submission urged by the
respondent, suffice would it be to note that there is no evidence
on record that the suit property was used for a commercial
purpose.

RSA.No.85/06

The lease deed, Ex.PW-1/1, admittedly binds the

Page 4 of 7

appellant to use the property for a residential purpose. Thus,
respondent cannot rely upon leases of properties where letting
is for a commercial purpose save and except if there is
evidence to show that in the area in question residential and
commercial properties were fetching comparable rents.
16.

No such evidence has been shown to me.

17.

The rents recorded in Ex. PW-1/28 to Ex. PW-1/30

cannot therefore be considered as good evidence to determine
the rent which the suit property would have fetched after
1.5.1997. The reason is obvious. The three leases pertain to
commercial tenancies.
18.

No doubt, land used of property No. B-50, South

Extension, Part I is residential, but it is a matter of knowledge
that residential buildings have been converted into commercial
buildings and misused with blatant impunity.
19.

The three leases, Ex. PW-1/28 to Ex. PW-1/30 show

that the said building has a lift and has an electricity connection
of a high rating.
20.

I thus hold that both Courts below were justified in

ignoring the rents which were recorded in Ex. PW-1/28 to Ex.
PW-1/30.
21.

In respect of the decisions cited by the respondent I

may only note that the rent in an area is a matter of fact to be
RSA.No.85/06

Page 5 of 7

gathered from the evidence brought before the court. The only
legal principle which can be discerned from the decisions is that
rents of similar and comparable properties can be looked into
while determining the mesne profits.
22.

Both Courts below have given good reasons as to

why mesne profits has been determined at Rs.20,000/- per
month.
23.

In respect of the plea of the respondent that 6 times

agreed rent cannot be labled as a penal rent, suffice would it
be to record that ex facie, 6 times agreed rent is penal in
nature.

But, I need not trouble myself on this issue for the

reason the lease between the parties, Ex.PW-1/1, does not
contain any covenant that in case the tenant overstays he
would be liable to pay penal rent which would be 6 times the
agreed rent.

The lease deed only records that in case the

lessee does not vacate the premises he would be liable to pay
damages.
24.

I find no merits in the cross objections.

25.

The cross objections are dismissed.

26.

As noted hereinabove the appeal was already

disposed of on 20.3.2007.
27.

The file be thus consigned to the record room.

28.

No costs.
