V.B. GUPTA, J.
Revenue has filed the present appeal under Section
260A of the Income Tax Act (for short to be referred as
'Act) challenging the order dated 14th February, 2005
passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench
“C” in IT(SS) No.455(Del)/2003 for block period assessment
year 1991-92 to 14th February, 2001.
2.

The relevant facts of this case are that a search

operation under Section 132 of the Act was carried out in
the Usha India Ltd. and Assessee is one of the promoters of
the said company. During the course of

search one

agreement to sell marked as AD 46 was seized from the
premises of the Assessee which was in respect of land
situated at Daultabad Road, Shivana, Gurgaon.

In this

agreement it has been mentioned that an earnest money of
Rs.34,01,784/- will be paid by the transferee to transferor
at the time of

signing of this agreement and balance

consideration of Rs.1,36,07,140/- would be paid within the
maximum period of three months, i.e., up to 16th April,
2001. This agreement was duly signed by Mr.Jaswant Rai
(Vendor)

and

ITA No.86/2006

Sh.Anil

Goel

(Vendee).

Though

the

Page 2 of 13

agreement

was

supposed

to

be

signed

by

another

transferor also, i.e., the present Assessee, the Assessee had
not signed this agreement and it was left blank and at the
time of seizure was lying with the Assessee.

When the

Assessee was asked about this sale, he replied that this
agreement was not executed and earnest money has not
been received. The Assessing Officer had added 50% of the
earnest money amount in the hands of the Assessee on the
ground that the money was equally shared by Assessee and
his brother.
3.

During the course of search, cash was also found from

the bed room of the Assessee, though the Assessee claimed
that the cash found was out of the withdrawals made by
him from the bank from time to time, the last withdrawal of
Rs.2 lacs was made from the bank on 4th December, 2000.
The Assessing Officer treated this as unexplained cash on
the ground that the explanation furnished by the Assessee
was not satisfactory as the household expenditure had not
been debited from this amount and logically

it is not

acceptable that the money drawn about two months ago
was lying with the Assessee.
ITA No.86/2006

Page 3 of 13

4.

The Assessee filed an appeal against the order of

block assessment and on both these issues, the appeal of
the Assessee was dismissed by CIT(A).
5.

Against the order of CIT(A), Assessee filed an appeal

before the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal which was
decided in favour of Assessee vide impugned order.
6.

It is argued by the learned counsel for the Revenue

that the impugned order of the Tribunal is liable to be set
aside as the Tribunal has failed to appreciate that
agreement was complete after the same was signed by the
vendor and the vendee. Secondly, documents were seized
from the premises of the Assessee and it was for

the

Assessee to satisfactorily explain about the documents but
Assessee has not given satisfactory explanation about the
receipt of earnest money.

Further, the Assessee has not

been able to prove the source of the cash found from his
bed room nor he could furnish satisfactory explanation
about the same. It is also contended that order of Income
Tax Appellate Tribunal is perverse as it has relied upon
decision of Apex Court in the case of the Dhakeswari
Cotton Mills Ltd v. Commissioner of Income Tax,
ITA No.86/2006

Page 4 of 13

(1954) 26 ITR 775 which is not applicable to the present
case.
7.

On the other hand, learned counsel for the Assessee

has argued that the Assessee had not signed the agreement
and thus there was no agreement in the eyes of law and
further the entire addition has been made by the Assessing
Officer on the basis of suspicion and surmises.
8.

The foremost question for consideration is as to

whether any substantial question of law arises in this case
or not and on this point certain judgments of Apex Court as
well as of this Court may be referred to.
9.

In case of Kondiba Dagadu Kadam v. Savitribai

Sopan Gujar AIR 1999 SC 2213 it has been explained as to
what can be termed as substantial question of law. It was
held:“If the question of law termed as
substantial question stands already
decided by a larger bench of the
High Court concerned or by the
Privy Council or by the federal Court
or by the Supreme Court, its mere
wrong application to facts of the
case would not be termed to be a
substantial question of law. Where a
point of law has not been pleaded or
is found to be arising between the
ITA No.86/2006

Page 5 of 13

10.

parties in the absence of any factual
format, a litigant should not be
allowed to raise that question as
substantial question of law in second
appeal. The mere appreciation of
the facts, the documentary evidence
or the meaning of entries and the
contents of the document cannot be
held to be raising a substantial
question of law. But where it is
found that the first appellate Court
has assumed jurisdiction which did
not vest in it, the same can be
adjudicated in the second appeal,
treating it as substantial question of
law. Where the first appellate Court
is shown to have exercised its
discretion in a judicial manner, it
cannot be termed to be an error
either of law or of procedure
requiring interference in second
appeal.”
In another case reported as Panchugopal Barua v.

Umesh Chandra Goswami, AIR 1997 SC 1041, it has
been laid down that existence of substantial question of law
is sine qua non for the exercise of jurisdiction. It was held:“ A bare look at Section 100 C.P.C.
shows that the jurisdiction of the
High Court to entertain a second
appeal after the 1976 amendment
is confined only to such appeals as
involve a substantial question of
law, specifically set out in the
memorandum
of
appeal
and
formulated by the High Court. Of
course, the proviso to the Section
shows that nothing shall be
ITA No.86/2006

Page 6 of 13

11.

deemed to take away or abridge
the power of the Court to hear, for
reasons to be recorded, the appeal
on any other substantial question
of law, not formulated by it, if the
Court is satisfied that the case
involves such a question.
The
proviso presupposes that the
Court shall indicate in its order
the substantial question of law
which it proposes to decide even if
such substantial question of law
was not earlier formulated by it.
The existence of a “substantial
question of law” is thus, the sine
qua non for the exercise of the
jurisdiction under the amended
provisions of Section 100 C.P.C.”
Similarly in a decision of this Court reported as

Mahavir Woolen Mills v.C.I.T.(Delhi), (2000) 245 ITR
297, meaning of “substantial question of law” has been
explained. It was held:“ The issue raised by the Assessee in
the appeal cannot be said to involve
any question of law, much less a
substantial question of law.
A
question of fact becomes a question
of law, if the finding is either
without any evidence or material, or
if the finding is contrary to the
evidence, or is perverse or there is
no direct nexus between the
conclusion of fact and the primary
fact upon which that conclusion is
based. But, it is not possible to turn
a mere question of fact into a
question of law by asking whether as
ITA No.86/2006

Page 7 of 13

a matter of law the authority came
to a correct conclusion upon a
matter of fact.
In Edwards v.Bairstow [1955] 28
ITR 579 (HL), Lord Simonds
observed that even a pure finding of
fact may be set aside by the court if
it appears that the commissioner has
acted without any evidence or on a
view of the facts which could not be
reasonably
entertained.
Lord
Radcliffe
stated
that
no
misconception may appear on the
face of the case, but it may be that
the facts found are such that no
person acting judicially and properly
instructed as to the relevant law
could
have
come
to
the
determination under appeal.
In
those circumstances the court may
intervene.
The words “ substantial question
of law” has not been defined. But
the expression has acquired a
definite connotation through a
catena of judicial pronouncements.
Usually five tests are used to
determine whether a substantial
question of law is involved. They are
as follows:1)whether, directly or indirectly, it
affects substantial rights of the
parties, or
2) the question is of general public
importance, or
3) whether it is an open question in
the sense that the issue has not
been settled by pronouncement of
the Supreme Court or Privy
Council or by the Federal Court,
ITA No.86/2006

Page 8 of 13

12.

or
4)the issue is not free from
difficulty, and
5) it calls for a discussion for
alternative view.”
Coming to the facts of the present case with regard to

the addition of Rs.17,00,892/- made by the Assessing
Officer as undisclosed income income of the Assessee for
the block period, we may refer to the findings of the
Tribunal on this point and the relevant portion reads as
under:“ On consideration of the matter we
find that the addition has been made
by the learned Assessing Officer on
the basis of surmises and guess work.
He has ignored the fact that the
agreement was found in possession of
the Assessee. Had the vendee made
substantial payment of Rs.34,01,784/he would have taken care of not
leaving the documents behind with
vendors only. The learned Assessing
Officer has also ignored the fact that
the agreement was not complete,
inasmuch as the Assessee had not
signed the agreement. The reasoning
given by the learned Assessing Officer
is entirely guess work.
It is well
settled legal position in respect of
income tax assessment proceedings
that although strict rules of Evidence
Act do not apply to Income-tax
proceedings, assessments cannot be
made on the basis of imagination and
guess work. Reference in this respect
ITA No.86/2006

Page 9 of 13

13.

may be made to the judgment of
Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd. vs.
CIT(1954) 26 ITR 775 (SC) and a host
of Supreme Court and High Court's
judgments thereafter on the subject.
We, therefore, direct deletion of the
sum of Rs.17,00,892/- assessed by the
Assessing Officer by way of half share
of the Assessee in the alleged earnest
money.”
It is an admitted fact that the present Assessee had

not signed the agreement in question and since the
Assessee had not signed the agreement, no liability can be
attributed qua that agreement towards the Assessee since
he is not party to the agreement till he had signed the
same. The mere fact that this agreement was found in the
possession of the Assessee does not lead us anywhere. We
find

no

hesitation

in

holding

that

this

addition

of

Rs.17,00,892/- made by Assessing Officer is based on
surmises and

guess work and on this point case of

Dhakeswari Cotton Mills Ltd v. Commissioner of
Income Tax, (1954) 26 ITR 775, may be referred to, in
which held:“ In making an assessment under
Section 23(3) of the Indian Income tax
Act, the Income-tax Officer is not
fettered by technical rules of evidence
ITA No.86/2006

Page 10 of 13

14.

and pleadings, and he is entitled to act
on material which may not be
accepted as evidence in a court of law,
but the Income-tax Officer is not
entitled to make a pure guess and
make an assessment without reference
to any evidence or any material at all.
There must be something more than
bare
suspicion
to
support
the
assessment under Section 23(3). The
rule of law on this subject has been
fairly and rightly stated by the Lahore
High Court in the case of Seth
Gurmukh Singh v.Commissioner of
Income-Tax, Punjab [(1944) 12 I.T.R.
393]”
The next ground taken up by the learned counsel for

the Revenue is with regard to the addition of Rs.2.5 lacs on
account of cash amounting to Rs.3,76,800/- found in the
bed room of the Assessee at the time of search.
15.

The

Assessee

However, the case

has

not

disputed

this

recovery.

of Assessee is that this represented

cash remaining from the withdrawal from his bank account
from time to time and a sum of Rs.2 lacs was received on
4th December, 2000 by cheque No.345947 and the
Assessee has furnished cash flow statement to this effect
also.
16.

This cash flow statement furnished by the Assessee

was rejected by the Assessing Officer which is on the basis
ITA No.86/2006

Page 11 of 13

of suspicion that the Assessee must have spent the amount
for some other purposes. The orders of Assessing Officer
as well as Commissioner of Income Tax are completely
silent as to for what purpose the earlier withdrawals would
have been spent. As per the cash book maintained by the
Assessee, a sum of Rs.10,000/- was being
household expenses

spent for

every month and the Assessee has

withdrawn from bank a sum of Rs. 2 lacs on 4th December,
2000 and there was no material with the Department that
this money was not available with the Assessee.

It has

been held by the Tribunal that in the instant case the
withdrawals shown by the Assessee are far in excess of the
cash found during the course of search proceedings.

No

material has been relied upon by the Assessing Officer or
Commissioner Income Tax(A) to support their view that the
entire cash withdrawals must have been spent by the
Assessee and accordingly, the Tribunal rightly

held that

the assessment of Rs.2.5 lacs is legally not sustainable
under Section 158BC of the Act and the same was rightly
ordered to be deleted.
17.

The above being the position, no fault can be found

ITA No.86/2006

Page 12 of 13

with the view taken by the Tribunal.

Thus, the order of

Tribunal does not give rise to a question of law, much less a
substantial question of law, to fall within the limited
purview of Section 260-A of the Act, which is confined to
entertaining only such appeal against the order which
involves a substantial question of law.
18.

Accordingly, the present appeal is, hereby, dismissed.
