1.

By this order, I propose to dispose of this application which

has been filed by the sole defendant under Order 37 Rule 3 (5) of
the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 praying for leave to defend the
present suit which has been filed under the summary procedure
provided under Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
2.

The suit has been filed by the plaintiff on the averments that

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 1 of 48

the plaintiff, Shri S.C. Gupta, was carrying on a business of interior
contractors as a sole proprietor under the name and style of M/s
S.C. Gupta & Bros. The plaintiff had good relations with Shri
Surender Sadhu, a Director in the defendant, a company
incorporated under the provisions of the Companies Act, 1956. On
account of such good relations, the plaintiff also remained as a
Director in the defendant company with effect from 31st May,
2000 till 31st January, 2002.
3.

The plaintiff advanced to the defendant several amounts as

loan account payee cheques or demand drafts between the period
16th December, 1998 to 13th September, 2000 totalling an
amount of Rs. 41 lakhs. The amount which was advanced by the
plaintiff wasreflected and acknowledged by the defendant as such
loan in their books of account, balance sheets and profit and loss
accounts, which were prepared and filed before the Registrar of
Companies as well as the income tax authorities.
4.

In partial discharge of its liability, the defendant paid an

amount of Rs. 4 lakh by way of cheque in September, 2000 which
was credited to the plaintiff's account on 16th September, 2000.
Further loan was requested and between 21st September, 2000
and 25th April, 2001, the plaintiff advanced a further amount of
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 2 of 48

Rs. 37,30,000/-. Details of payments made to the defendant by
the plaintiff have been detailed in para 5 of the plaint. Thereafter,
the defendant repaid a sum of Rs. 1.50 lakhs by two cheques dated
2nd March and 15th March, 2001. At the time of filing of the suit,
the defendant was owing a sum of Rs. 72,80,000/- to the plaintiff
for which the plaintiff filed the suit on 26th March, 2004.
5.

After the suit was filed on 29th March, 2004, the plaintiff

filed an application being I.A. No. 4876/2004 seeking amendment
of

the

plaint

to

incorporate

certain

subsequent

events/developments which have taken place after the filing of the
suit. This application was allowed on 5th August, 2004. By way of
the amendment, the plaintiff has brought on record the fact that
on 31st March, 2004 and 1st of April, 2004, Shri Surender Sadhu,
Managing Director of the defendant approached the plaintiff to
settle the outstanding loans. He requested that the defendant was
not in a position to repay the entire amount of Rs. 72,80,000/and expressed the desire to make payment in a full and final
settlement of its dues by payment of Rs. 47,00,000/- .
6.

With a view to maintaining good relations, the plaintiff

agreed to this proposal and the parties signed a Memorandum of
Understanding dated 1st April, 2004.
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 3 of 48

Pursuant to this

Memorandum of Understanding, the defendant issued cheques to
the plaintiff, however, the cheque dated 5th April, 2004 issued by
the defendant in terms of the Memorandum was dishonoured on
account of insufficiency of funds in the defendant's account. The
plaintiff consequently has pleaded that this Memorandum of
Understanding is not binding on the plaintiff. The plaintiff in the
amended plaint has restricted the liability of the defendant to Rs.
43,80,000/-.
7.

The plaintiff has placed strong reliance on the letter dated

2nd September, 2001 whereby the defendant acknowledged an
amount of Rs. 64,30,000/- as outstanding and payable to the
plaintiff on 31st March, 2001. After 31st March, 2001, the plaintiff
advanced a further loan of Rs. 8,50,000/- to the defendant. The
defendant issued three cheques to the plaintiff; one dated 17th
February, 2004 and two cheques, each dated 8th March, 2004, for
the total sum of Rs. 17,00,000/- to the plaintiff in partial discharge
of its liability. When presented for encashment in February and
March, 2004, these three cheques were dishonoured by the bank
with the remarks that the account stood closed. These cheques
were dishonoured on 19th February, 2004 and 9th March, 2004
respectively giving rising to the cause of action for the plaintiff to
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 4 of 48

file the present suit.
8.

Basing its claim also on the acknowledgement in the balance

sheet and profit and loss account for the financial year ending 31st
March, 1999, 31st March, 2000, 31st March, 2001 and 31st March,
2002, the plaintiff originally filed the suit on 26th March, 2004 for
a principal sum of Rs. 72,80,000/-.
9.

The defendant entered appearance on receipt of summons in

the suit. The plaintiff thereafter sought summons for judgment to
be issued in the prescribed form. The present application has
been filed on 13th of October, 2004 seeking leave to defend.
10.

A preliminary objection has been taken by the plaintiff to

maintainability of this application on the ground of limitation.
Before dealing with the pleas of the defendant in the application, it
would be appropriate to consider this objection. The advance copy
of the I.A. No. 6307/2004, whereby the plaintiff had sought
issuance of summons for judgment, was served upon counsel for
the defendant against receipt on 20th September, 2004. Based on
this service, it is urged that the leave to defend ought to have been
filed within ten days thereof on or before 30th September, 2004.
The same having been filed on 13th October, 2004, according to
the plaintiff the present application seeking leave to defend is
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 5 of 48

barred by limitation. Reliance is placed on the pronouncement of
this court reported in AIR 1992 Delhi

159 Projects and

Equipment Corporation of India Ltd. Vs. H.C. Suri &
Ors.
11.

I find that I.A. No. 6307/2004 was listed before this court

on 2nd September, 2004. The plaintiff accepted that service of
advance copy was not adequate service upon the defendant
inasmuch as it has permitted the Joint Registrar to pass an order
for issuance of summons for judgment against the defendant in
the prescribed proforma, returnable on 12th October, 2004. The
plaintiff also filed the requisite process fee for issuance of
summons for judgment which was thus issued to the defendant.
In this view of the matter, the judgment in Projects and
Equipment Corporation of India Ltd. (supra) would have
no application inasmuch in that case, the defendant no. 1 had
accepted service of the copy of the application for the same and
annexures thereto as service of summons for judgment and
consequently, the court had issued summons for judgment only to
the remaining defendants. In this view of the matter, the objection
of the plaintiff based on this service of advance copy of the
application for the summons is hereby rejected.
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 6 of 48

12.

The plaintiff has taken yet another objection for urging that

the present application is barred by limitation. Placing reliance on
the affidavit of service dated 8th October, 2004 filed by it, the
plaintiff has asserted that the defendant was served with the
summons for judgment on 25th September, 2004. The plaintiff
along with this affidavit has placed the receipt given by the courier
company purporting to be duly receipted by the defendant.
Perusal of the receipt which has been enclosed with the affidavit
shows that there are no signatures where the particulars of the
consignee/addressee are to appear. This cannot be accepted as
valid proof of service for summons of judgment on 25th
September, 2004. Furthermore, on 22nd September, 2004, the
court had directed service by registered cover A.D. as well as by
courier. The plaintiff did not file a properly and duly stamped
registered cover and for this reason, the summons could not be
issued by registered post. In this view of the matter, I am not
inclined to accept the contention of the plaintiff that the defendant
was served with the summons for judgment on the 25th of
October, 2004 and for this reason, the application for leave to
defend filed on 13th October, 2004 is barred by time.
13.

The defendant has contended that he received the summons

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 7 of 48

for judgment on 4th October, 2004 and has filed the application
on 13th October, 2004. There is no material on record to the
contrary. I am therefore inclined to accept the contention of the
defendant on this ground and reject the objection of the plaintiff to
the effect that this application deserved to be rejected on the
ground that the same is barred by limitation.
14.

So far as the grounds on which leave to defend has been

sought by the defendant, by way of the present application, the
defendant raises the following pleas:- (i) the suit of the plaintiff is
barred under the provisions of Punjab Registration of Money
Lenders' Act, 1938. (ii) The money claimed by the plaintiff is not a
debt or a liquidated demand under contract and consequently, the
present suit filed under Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure,
1908 is not maintainable.

(iii) The suit claim is barred by

limitation inasmuch as each cheque allegedly paid by the plaintiff
was an independent transaction and consequently gave rise to
independent causes of action. The suit having been filed more
than three years beyond the date of the cheques is barred by
limitation.
15.

I heard learned counsels for the parties at great length and

have given my considered thought to the rival contentions. I first
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 8 of 48

take up the objection of the defendant that the suit is barred by the
provisions of Punjab Registration of Money Lenders' Act, 1938 for
consideration. The first question which arises is as to whether this
enactment applies to the transactions between the plaintiff and the
defendant. The Act has been enacted to regulate the business of
money lenders and was effectuated in order to register money
lenders for this purpose.

The expression 'money-lender' is

statutorily defined under Section 2 sub-section 9 thus:"Section- 2(9):- “Money-lender”
means
a
person, or a firm carrying on the business of
advancing loans as defined in this Act, and shall
include the legal representatives and the
successors-in-interest whether by inheritance;
assignment or otherwise, of such person or firm;
provided that nothing in this definition shall
apply to (a) a person who is the legal
representative or is by inheritance the successorin-interest of the estate of a deceased moneylender together with all his rights and liabilities;
provided that such person only (i)
winds up the estate of such money-lender;
(ii) realises outstanding loans;
(iii) does not renew any existing loan, nor
advance any fresh loan;
(b) a bona fide assignment by a money-lender
of a single loan to any one other than the wife or
husband of such assignor, as the case may be, or
any person, who is descended from a common
grandfather of the assignor."
It is therefore apparent that this statute would have
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 9 of 48

applicability only in respect of and against persons of firms who
are engaged in the business of advancing loans as defined under
the Act. The expression 'loan' is defined under sub-section 8 of
Section 2. 'Loan' has been defined to mean an advance, whether
secured or unsecured, of money or in kind at interest and shall
include any transaction which the court finds to be in substance a
loan. Certain exceptions to this definition has been carved out and
under sub-clause (vi) of sub-section 8 of Section 2 it is specifically
stipulated that a loan advanced by a trader to a trader in the
regular course of business, in accordance with trade usage shall
not be covered under the definition of the loan.
16.

I find that in this application, apart from a bald allegation

that the

suit is barred under the Punjab Registration of Money

Lenders' Act, 1938, there is nothing further.

I find that the

plaintiff has contested the claim of the defendant that the amount
given to it was advanced by the plaintiff as a Director of the
company.

Even assuming that the investment was made by the

plaintiff in the capacity of a director of the defendant-company in
the form of a loan to the company. I find that there is no plea in
the application that the plaintiff is a money lender by profession
within the meaning of expression under Section 2 (9) of the
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 10 of 48

statute.
17.

In AIR 1952 Punjab 207 Amar Singh Vs. Kuldeep

Singh, it was held by the court that a man does not become a
'money lender' merely by reason of casual loans to relations,
friends or acquaintances, whether interest be charged or not nor
does a man become a money lender merely because he may, upon
one or several occasions, lend money to a stranger. There must be
a business of money lending and the 'business' imports the notion
of system, repetition and continuity to be covered under the
definition of money lender under this statute.
18.

This very issue has arisen for consideration before this court

and in the pronouncement reported at AIR 1973 Delhi 44 S.L.
Luthra Vs. Narender Kumar Puri, the court held thus:“5. The petitioner through his affidavit raised
such pleas which can easily be raised in respect of
any suit brought on the basis of a promissory
note. In his affidavit no instances of money
lending by the plaintiff-respondent were cited. It
is open to a defendant in every suit brought on a
promissory note to plead that the plaintiff is a
money lender and has not been submitting six
monthly statements of account which a registered
money lender is to submit.
In suits covered by Order 37, Rule 2 of the
Code every possible care should be taken by the
trial Courts in coming to the conclusion whether
the issues raised are triable or not. There should
be a further finding whether the defence raised is
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 11 of 48

bona fide or not. The Court is not to be
impressed by mere assertions, whether of facts or
of law. The Court must examine the merits of all
the contentions raised in order to obtain leave to
defend that suit. Unless the trial Courts act
strictly in accordance with the requirements of
Order 37 of the Code the provisions contained
therein may be rendered ineffective.”
It is noteworthy that the defendant has failed to place even a
single instance of money lending transaction by the defendant on
the record of the present case and has made merely a bald
allegation unsupported by any material. In this view of the matter,
the pleas raised by the defendant are certainly insufficient to hold
that the plaintiff was in the business of money lending and that the
suit was not maintainable for the reason that the plaintiff was not
registered under the Punjab Registration of Money Lenders' Act,
1938.
19.

It now becomes necessary to consider the second and third

objection raised by the defendant to the maintainability of the suit
on the ground that the same is not based on a debt or a liquidated
demand or on a written contract and could not be filed under
Order 37 of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and that the claim is
barred by limitation. Inasmuch as these objections are based on
the same documents and legal submissions they are required to be
considered together.
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 12 of 48

20.

From the plaint and the documents placed on record, it is

apparent that the plaintiff advanced amounts to the defendant
between the period 16th December, 1998 to 13th September,
2000. The plaintiff became a director of the defendant-company
and remained its director with effect from 31st May, 2000 till 31st
January, 2002. From the statements of accounts placed before
this court, it is evident that the plaintiff has made payments to the
defendant before the date he became the director of the defendant
and even thereafter.
21.

Before this court the plaintiff has placed certified copies of

the balance sheet duly certified by a chartered accountant. Perusal
of the balance sheet of the defendant-company as on 31st March,
1999 shows that it was owing an amount of Rs. 17,00,000/- to Shri
S.C. Gupta who has given unsecured loan in the category of
'unsecured loans from others' as on 31st March, 1999.

The

amount due to the plaintiff has been so reflected even in the
balance sheet of 31st March, 2000 and the same amount has been
shown. As on 31st March, 2001, Shri S.C. Gupta is shown to have
advanced an unsecured loan of Rs. 62,30,000/- while in the
balance sheet as on 31st March, 2002, Shri S.C. Gupta is shown to
have advanced unsecured loan to the tune of Rs. 72,80,000/-.
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 13 of 48

Thus, the amounts payable to the plaintiff are not reflected
by the defendant under the column of loans from directors but
under the category of "unsecured loans from others"

The

submission that the plaintiff had advanced money as a director of
the company is therefore wholly without merit and fallacious.
22.

These acknowledgements in the balance sheets of the owings

to the plaintiff have been relied upon by it for two purposes. Mr.
Rajesh Mahajan, learned counsel for the plaintiff has urged that
such acknowledgements would be covered within the meaning of
expression 'debt' so as to enable the plaintiff to base the suit on the
same. It has been secondly urged that such debt shown in a
balance sheet of a company is an acknowledgement within the
meaning of Section 19 of the Limitation Act.
23.

Section 18 and 19 of the Limitation Act which have bearing

on the respective contentions of the parties read thus:"18. Effect of acknowledgment in writing (1)
Where, before the expiration of the
prescribed period for a suit or application in
respect of any property or right, an
acknowledgment of liability in respect of such
property or right has been made in writing
signed by the party against whom such property
or right is claimed, or by any person through
whom he derives his title or liability, a fresh
period of limitation shall be computed from the
time when the acknowledgment was so signed.
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 14 of 48

(2)
Where the writing containing the
acknowledgment is undated, oral evidence may
be given of the time when it was signed; but
subject to the provisions of the Indian Evidence
Act, 1872 (1 of 1872), oral evidence of its
contents shall not be received.
Explanation:- For the purposes of this section(a)
an acknowledgment may be sufficient
though it omits to specify the exact nature of the
property or right, or avers that the time for
payment, delivery, performance or enjoyment
has not yet come or is accompanied by a refusal
to pay, deliver, perform or permit to enjoy, or is
coupled with a claim to set-off, or is addressed
to a person other than a person entitled to the
property or right;
(b) the word "signed" means signed either
personally or by an agent duly authorised in this
behalf; and
(c) an application for the execution of a decree
or order shall not be deemed to be an
application in respect of any property or right.
19. Effect of payment on account of debt
or of interest on legacy - Where payment on
account of a debt or of interest on a legacy is
made before the expiration of the prescribed
period by the person liable to pay the debt or
legacy or by his agent duty authorised in this
behalf, a fresh period of limitation shall be
computed from the time when the payment was
made:
Provided that, save in the case of payment of
interest made before the 1st day of January,
1928, an acknowledgement of the payment
appears in the handwriting of, or in a writing
signed by, the person making the payment.
Explanation - For the purposes of this section (a) where mortgaged land is in the possession of
the mortgagee, the receipt of the rent or produce
of such land shall be deemed to be a payment;
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 15 of 48

24.

(b) "debt" does not include money payable
under a decree or order of a court."
My attention has been drawn to the judgment of the Gujarat

High Court reported at AIR 1964 Gujarat 208 Ambika Mills
Ltd., Ahmedabad Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax,
Gujarat, wherein the court has held that a debt shown in a
balance-sheet is an acknowledgment within the meaning of S.19 of
the Limitation Act, and in order to be so, a balance-sheet in which
such acknowledgment is made need not be addressed to the
creditor.
25.

This court has an occasion to consider the effect of an

acknowledgement made by a company in its balance sheets in
several binding precedents. In the judicial pronouncement
reported at 73 (1998) DLT 593 Rishi Pal Gupta Vs. M/s S.J.
Knitting and Finishing Mills Pvt. Ltd., this court has held
thus:“14. The respondent in its balance sheet for the
year ending 31.3.1990 has admitted that the
petitioner is one of the sundry creditors of the
respondent Company and its name is shown in
the list of sundry creditors in the said balance
sheet. The respondent has also admitted its
liability in its reply dated 22.11.1991 whereunder
it has transmitted the said balance sheet to the
Registrar of Companies. The Division Bench of
this Court has also in its order dated 29.11.1995
recorded that there is an admission of liability by
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 16 of 48

the respondent to the extent of Rs.6,89,870.76
and that the said liability was acknowledged by
the respondent in its reply dated 22.11.1991. In
view of the aforesaid acknowledgment of debt in
the balance sheet as also in the reply sent by the
respondent through one of its Directors
constituting acknowledgment in writing within
the meaning of Section 18 of the Limitation Act,
the petition presented by the petitioner on
14.5.1992 to enforce a liability of the Company
acknowledged in the balance sheet for the year
ending 31.3.1990 is indisputably within time.
Reference may also be made to a decision of this
Court in Larsen & Toubro Ltd. v. Commercial
Electrical Works and Others, reported in 67
(1997) Delhi Law Times 387 wherein this Court
referred to the decision reported in ILR 33
Calcutta 1033 wherein it was held that a
statement of accounts like balance sheet would
constitute acknowledgment of liability.
The
decisions relied upon by the Counsel for the
respondent also have taken the same view with
which I respectfully agree.”
26.

In 115 (2004) DLT 529 R.K. Chemicals Vs. M/s

Kohinoor Paints Faridabad Pvt. Ltd., in para 7, the court
held thus:"7. .....It is the balance sheet only, which can be
relied for this purpose and that is of 31st March,
1996. The claim is, therefore, time barred."
27.

In 67 (1997) DLT 387 Larsen & Tubro Ltd. Vs.

Commercial Electric Works & Ors., the court also had an
occasion to consider the legal impact of an acknowledgement in a
balance sheet and had held thus:CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 17 of 48

“16. Mr. Jain learned Sr. Counsel for the
defendants apart from arguing on merits
submitted that the suit was barred by time. Mr.
Kohli the learned Counsel for the plaintiff relied
upon the letter written by the Income Tax Officer
in January 1981 to the defendants wherein the
Income Tax Officer had said that the defendants
had shown in the balance sheet for the year
ended 31.3.78 a sum of Rs.1,74,000/- as due
from the defendants to the plaintiff and the
plaintiff, therefore, filed an application for a
direction to the defendants to file the balance
sheet. Mr. Kohli learned Counsel for the plaintiff
contends that the balance sheet wherein the
defendants itself had shown that particular
amount is due to the plaintiff would constitute an
acknowledgment within the meaning of Section
18 of the Limitation Act, 1963. As I had already
noticed that the last payment by cheque by the
defendants was on 1.8.80, the plaint was
presented on 14.12.81, therefore, the suit is in
time. I need not go into the question of
acknowledgment but it is well settled in ILR 33
Cal 1033 that such a statement in accounts would
constitute acknowledgment of liability. In any
view of the matter the suit is in time.”
28.

Section 18 of the Limitation Act requires a suit to be filed

within three years of an acknowledgement of the owing. In the
pronouncement reported at AIR (39) 1952 Madras 136 Rajah
of Vizianagaram Vs. Official Liquidator, so far as
limitation based on such acknowledgement in a balance sheet was
concerned, the court had held thus:“(33) C.M.A.No.252 of 1949: In this appeal,
Arthur Stanley Lindley, the petitioner in the
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 18 of 48

Lower Court claimed a sum of £ 746-1-2 as being
due to him and the question here is one of
limitation. The lower Court has held that it is
included in the item of £ 4897-7-7 relating to
sundry creditors as contained in the balance sheet
Ex.P-1. In 'Jones vs. Bellgrove Properties Ltd.',
(1949) 2 K B D 700 the Court of Appeal held that
where a balance sheet presented to the
shareholders at annual general meeting of a
limited liability company signed by the chartered
accountants etc., contained the statement “to
sundry creditors £ 76381, 6s.10d” and it was
proved by a witness from the firm of chartered
accountants which had signed the balance sheet
that the debt of £ 1,807 owed by the company to
the plaintiff was included in the sum of £ 7638,
8s.10d. stated in the balance sheet to be due to
sundry creditors, the balance sheet contained an
acknowledgment to the plaintiff in writing signed
by the agents of the company that the debt of £
1807 at the date of the annual general meeting
remained unpaid and due to the plaintiff.
Therefore by virtue of Ss.23 and 24 of the
Limitation Act, 1939, the debt was held to be
recoverable. Mr. Tiruvenkatachari contends that
this decision should not be applied and is
erroneous. On the other hand Mr. Rajah Ayyar
contends that the observations of the Privy
Council in 'Maniram Seth v. Seth Rupchand', 33
Cal 1047 at p.1060 are to the effect that the
provisions of the Limitation Act in England
regarding acknowledgment are more stringent
than what they are in India. We have not been
shown any reason why the judgment of the Court
of Appeal should not be followed by us. From the
affidavit submitted by John Hawkins, it is clear
that £ 746-1-2 is included in the debts due to
sundry creditors. In these circumstances we feel
that the decision of the District Judge is right and
this appeal is dismissed with costs.”

The High Court of Punjab & Haryana also had an occasion to

consider this issue. In its pronouncement reported at AIR 1958
Punjab 341 Lahore Enamelling and Stamping Co. Ltd.
Vs. A.K. Bhalla & Ors., the court laid down the principles
thus:“37. All the claims mentioned above are
acknowledged in the balance sheet for the year
ending 31-12-1950. In two cases the specific
amounts are shown to be due to the Managing
Director (Shri Bhagwan Das) and to technical
expert (Shri A.K. Bhalla).
Loans due to
unsecured creditors are stated to be
Rs.1,22,099/10/9.
There is evidence on the record to show
that the above amount includes sums due to
Shrimati Yash Kumari Bhalla and Dr. Tara
Chand, vide Exhibit P.1. All these entries
constitute an acknowledgment of the debts due
to the claimants within the meaning of S.19 of
the Indian Limitation Act.
Debts due to creditors not mentioned by
name but included in the item relating to “Loans
(unsecured)” or as due to “Sundry Creditors”
mentioned in the balance sheet amount to an
acknowledgment within the provisions of S.19 of
the Indian Limitation Act, so as to extend the
period of Limitation Act with effect from the
date of the signing of the acknowledgment. For
this proposition, reference may be made to
Rajah of Vizianagaram v. Vizianagaram Mining
Co. Ltd., AIR 1952 Mad 136 (U); 1918 Mad WN
(SN) 48 (V); and Jones v. Bellegrove Properties
Ltd., (1949) 1 All ER 498 (W). The facts of the
last case were that in 1936 the plaintiff had lent
a sum of £ 1,807 to the defendant company in
which he was a shareholder. At the annual
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 20 of 48

general meeting of the company in December,
1946, the plaintiff was handed by a director the
accounts of the company, signed by the
accountants and two directors, which included
the balance sheets for the years 1939 to 1945, in
each of which was the entry:”Sundry creditors £
7,638 8s.lod.'
It was held by the King's Bench Division
that parol evidence was admissible to show that
the sum mentioned in the entry included the
debt due to the plaintiff; and further that the
entry,
thus
explained,
constituted
an
acknowledgment within the meaning of the
Limitation Act, 1939, Ss.28(4) and 24(1).”
30.

Apart from the admissions contained in the balance sheets,

perusal of the record shows that the first payment by the plaintiff
was made to the defendant on 16th December, 1998. The plaintiff
has urged that it has maintained running account of the amounts
advanced and the amounts received from the defendant. The first
repayment by the defendant was by a cheque dated 16th
September, 2000 for Rs. 4.00 lakhs. Clearly this partial payment
on account of the debt was made before expiry of the prescribed
period of limitation computed from the date of the plaintiff's
payment on the 16th of December, 1998. Consequently, in terms of
Section 19 a fresh period of limitation would require to be
computed from 16th September, 2000 when this cheque was paid.
Likewise, the second and third payment of Rs. 50,000/- and Rs.

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 21 of 48

1,00,000/- were made by way of cheque dated 2nd March, 2001
and 15th March, 2001. Three further cheques were given by the
defendant in February and March, 2004. The last payments from
the defendant in this case have been made by cheque no. 690246
dated 12th April, 2004 for the sum of Rs. 18,00,000/- and vide
cheque dated 15th April, 2004 bearing no. 690248 for the amount
of Rs. 11,00,000/-. The debt in the present case, therefore, is by
no means time barred. The initial suit is within time from the date
of payments made by the defendant by the cheque nos. 513249,
513248 and 513247, the first was dishonoured on 19th January,
2004 and the other two on 9th March, 2004. The amended suit is
within three years from the last payments which were made by the
defendant vide cheque nos. 690246 and 690248 dated 12th April
and 15th April, 2004 respectively as also dishonouring of the
cheque no. 690427 which was dishonoured on 22nd July, 2004.
31.

It is noteworthy that each of these payments was within

three years of the last payment and on each date limitation would
require to be computed afresh from the date when the payments
were rendered. On these facts alone, the present suit having been
filed on 29th March, 2004 would have to be held within limitation.
32.

The defendant can claim no benefit from the act of

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 22 of 48

dishonouring of the cheque. It is well settled that dishonouring of
the cheque would not wipe out an advantage of extension of
limitation which is earned by the creditor on the issuance of such
cheque. (Ref: AIR 1998 Delhi 80 para 6-15 Rajesh Kumari
Vs. Prem Chand Jain; decision dated 5th September, 2005
rendered in CS(OS) No. 2342/1998 Hindustan Petroleum
Corporation Vs. Tajiskstan International Airlines).
33.

There is yet another aspect to the objection relating to the

suit being barred by limitation. The defendant has admittedly
issued a letter dated 2nd September, 2001 wherein it has stated
thus:"Dated: 2nd September, 2001
To,
S.C. Gupta & Bros.
240, Top Floor,
Satya Niketan,
New Delhi-100021
Kind attn: Mr. S.C. Gupta
Dear Sir,
This is to certify that the loan amount of Rs.
64.30 lakhs (Rs. Sixty Four Lacs Thirty Thousand
only) outstanding, payable to you in our records
as on 31st March, 2001.
For: Allied Beverages Co. Pvt. Ltd.
Sd/Asst. Manager Accounts
(Uma Shanker Gupta)"

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 23 of 48

Herein contained is an acknowledgement that the loan
amount of Rs. 64.30 lakhs is outstanding and payable by the
defendant and the same has been advanced after the 31st of
March, 2001. The present suit has been filed within three years of
acknowledgement made by the defendant.
34.

I further find that in the Memorandum of Understanding

dated 1st April, 2004, the defendant has yet again acknowledged
and admitted that it owes a sum of Rs. 72,80,000/- to the plaintiff
which it has taken as a loan by way of cheques and drafts. There is
a clear and unequivocal acknowledgement that this loan is duly
reflected in the books of account i.e. the balance sheet.
relevant extract of this MOU reads thus:".....Whereas the first party owes to the second
party a sum of Rs. 72.80 lacs (Rs. Seventy Two
Lacs Eighty Thousand only) which the first party
has taken as loan from the second party by way
of cheque/draft/. The said loan is also reflected
in books of accounts i.e. Balance Sheets of the
first party.
Whereas the first party has not been able to pay
the second party the loan amount mentioned
above and therefore the first party has
approached the second party for amicable
settlement of its dues.
Now this MOU witnessed as under:1. That the first party hereby confirms and
acknowledges that a sum of Rs. 72.80 lacs (Rs.
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 24 of 48

The

Seventy Two Lacs Eighty Thousand only) is
payable by the first party to second party towards
the loan advance by the second party to first
party."
Certainly, this statement is also an acknowledgement of the
debt of the defendant within the meaning of Section 18 of the
Limitation Act.
35.

The defendant has urged at great length that issuance of

every cheque was an independent transaction and that so far as
the owings of the defendant are concerned, the same would lapse
so far as the amount of a particular cheque was concerned, on
expiry of period of three years from the date of its issuance.
36.

I find that the plaintiff has maintained a running account so

far the transactions with the defendant are concerned. The loan
transactions have been made through cheques and demand drafts
and repayments have come through the same mode. The plaintiff
has extended amounts to the defendant-company from time to
time and the defendant has made partial payments from time to
time. Thus, in the instant case, in my view, the limitation would
not commence on expiry of the prescribed period from date of
issuance of each cheque.
37.

There is yet another angle to this case. It is well settled that

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 25 of 48

in order to maintain a suit against the defendant, there must
accrue cause of action for filing the same. In the instant case, there
was no occasion for the plaintiff to believe that the loan taken by
the defendant would not be repaid. The defendant did tender
some cheques which were honoured.

The defendant had also

acknowledged the amounts due in its letter dated 2nd September,
2001. Therefore, inasmuch as the defendant kept acknowledging
the loan, the same would amount to a promise to pay the plaintiff
towards the loan.

The first time that the cheques were

dishonoured were on 19th February, 2004, and 9th March, 2004.
38.

The question which needs to be answered is as to when the

cause of action could be said to have accrued to enable the filing of
the suit. In this behalf, it would be appropriate to advert to the
observations of the Apex Court in its judgment reported at (1999)
8 SCC 122 SAIL Vs. J.C. Budhiraja, wherein the court held
thus:“28. Learned counsel for the respondent relied
upon the decision of this Court in Major (Retd.)
Inder Singh Rekhi v. Delhi Development
Authority for contending that cause of action for
referring the claim arises only when the
appellant disputed the right of the respondent to
recover the damages claimed by him. In the
said case, the Court has observed that on
completion of the work, the right to get payment
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 26 of 48

would clearly arise, but wherein the final bills
have not been prepared and when the assertion
of the claim was made on 28-2-1983 and there
was non-payment, the cause of action arose
from that date. In that case, application under
Section 20 was filed in January 1986. The Court
also observed that: (SCC p.340, para 4)
“It is also true that the party cannot
postpone the accrual of cause of action by
writing reminders or sending reminders but
where the bill had not been finally prepared, the
claim made by a claimant is the accrual of the
cause of action. A dispute arises where there is
a claim and a denial and repudiation of the
claim. The existence of dispute is essential for
appointment of an arbitrator under Section 8 or
a reference under Section 20 of the Act. See
Law of Arbitration by R.S. Bachawat, 1st Edn.,
p.354. There should be dispute and there can
only be a dispute when a claim is asserted by
one party and denied by the other on whatever
grounds. Mere failure or inaction to pay does
not lead to the inference of the existence of
dispute. Dispute entails a positive element and
assertion of denying, not merely inaction to
accede to a claim or a request. Whether in a
particular case a dispute has arisen or not has
to be found out from the facts and
circumstances of the case”.
Therefore, a dispute arises when the plaintiff made a claim
which was denied by the defendant.

In the instant case, the

disputes having arising when the cheques were first dishonured on
19th February, 2004, then on 9th March, 2004 and again when the
cheque dated 15th April, 2004 has got dishonoured on 22nd July,
2004. it is only by such dishonouring of the cheques that the
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 27 of 48

plaintiff would have got an indication that the defendant did not
intend to honour its commitment. As such, the plaint as initially
filed and the amended plaint within three years of the accrual of
the cause of action is clearly within limitation.
39.

It is equally well settled that bouncing of cheque would not

have any effect on the impact of the tender of cheque so far as
limitation is concerned. In this behalf, the pronouncement of this
court reported at AIR 1998 Delhi 80 para 6-15 Rajesh
Kumari Vs. Prem Chand Jain; and decision dated 5th
September, 2005 rendered in CS(OS) No. 2342/1998
Hindustan

Petroleum

Corporation

Vs.

Tajiskstan

International Airlines (para 13) deserve to be adverted to.
40.

The defendant has urged at great length that so far as the

amount actually due and payable by the defendant is concerned, it
cannot be determined from the pleadings or the documents as
filed and that evidence requires to be led in this behalf before
ascertainment of the liability. It is contended that the defendant is
entitled to challenge such evidence and cross examine the plaintiff
and his witnesses. Mr. T. Nath, learned counsel for the defendant
has urged that the defendant is consequently entitled to leave to
defend.
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 28 of 48

41.

I find that the plaintiff has placed complete details of the

cheques which have been issued towards the loan advanced to the
defendant. The amounts received from the defendant have also
been detailed and statements of account have also been filed as
Annexure 'A' to the amended suit.

The amount which was

advanced by the plaintiff is acknowledged in the balance sheet of
the defendant.

The plaintiff has asserted that it has paid an

amount of Rs. 64.30 lakhs and additionally, Rs. 3.50 lakhs on 21st
April, 2001. The plaintiff has further advanced an amount of Rs. 5
lakhs on 24th April, 2001. Against this, the defendant has repaid
an amount of Rs. 18.00 lakhs on 12th April, 2004 and Rs. 11.00
lakhs on 15th April, 2004 leaving a balance amount due and
payable by the defendant of Rs. 43,80,000/-. The payments made
by the defendant stand duly stated before this court. The cheques
which were issued and dishonoured have been placed on record.
42.

The defendant has not urged that it has made any other

payment to the plaintiff. In these circumstances, even the amount
which the defendant is liable to pay to the plaintiff is clearly
established on record.
43.

The defendant has objected that the suit claim is not covered

under the definition of debt and liquidated demand under Order
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 29 of 48

37 of the Code of Civil Procedure. This objection is taken up last
for consideration as it entails consideration of the various
documents noticed hereinabove. In this factual background, it
now becomes necessary to consider the meaning assigned to the
expression

'debt'

pronouncements.

and

'liquidated

The

expression

demand'
'debt'

has

in

judicial

arisen

for

consideration in several cases prior hitherto. In AIR 2000 Delhi
156 (para 10) S.B. Electricals Vs. Sylvania Laxman, the
court held thus:"10.
The plaintiff's reliance on Food
Corporation of India v. Bal Krishan, (1982) 21
Delhi LT 167 which is a Division Bench
judgment of this Court, is also misplaced. A
reading of this decision discloses that 500
Rolls of black polythene film had been
supplied pursuant to a tender. The defence
against payment was, inter alia, that Order
XXXVBII did not apply since the goods
supplied, upon subsequent examination, were
found deficient and inferior in quality, and
that interest had not been agreed upon in
writing. These objections were negatives and
the relevant paragraphs read as follows:“Regarding the objection as to the
maintainability of the suit raised by the
appellant appellants, we are of the view that
where the suit is for recovery of the price of the
goods, it should be construed as a suit for
enforcing payment of a debt, within the
amended clause (b) of sub-rule (2) of Rule 1 of
Order 37, C.P.C. which covers a few more
categorises of suits and not being inconsistent
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 30 of 48

with Rule 1 of Chapter XV of the Original Side
Rules will govern the present suit, vide Rule 12
of the said Rules, as explained in
M/s.Printpack Machinery Ltd. v. M/s.Jay Kay
Paper Congeters, AIR 1979 Delhi 217, Avadh
Behari J. in Sushila Mehta v. Shri Bansi Lal
Arora and another, I.A. 3032/81 in suit
No.93/81, decided on 26.10.1981, has held
that the amendment of Order 37, CP.C. is
neither repugnant nor inconsistent with
Chapter XV of the Original Side Rules, and a
suit on a debt arising out of a written contract
can be brought under the summary procedure.
We are in respectful agreement with that view.
What then, is a debt? Relying in Webb v.
Stention, (1883) 11 OBD 518 it was held in
Commissioner of Wealth Tax v. Pierce Leslie
and Co. Ltd., AIR 1963 Mad 356, that the
essential requisites of a debt are (1) an
ascertained or readily calculable amount; (2)
an absolute unqualified and present liability in
regard to that amount with the obligation to
pay forthwith or in future within a time
certain; (3) the obligation must have accrued
and be subsisting and should not be that which
is merely accruing. A contingent liability or a
contingency debt is, therefore, neither a
liability nor a debt. A debt is a 'debitum in
praesenti, solvendum in future.'
We,
therefore, hold that the amount payable under
an unqualified present liability. the obligation
has accrued and subsists. It is a debt accruing
under a written contract. The learned counsel
for the defendant wanted to urge that the
words “arising on a written contract” must be
read along with the word “interest” and since
no interest was payable under the contract the
suit is not covered by clause (b) of Rule 2 of
Order 37, C.P.C. This is an argument totally
unsupportable.
The words “arising on a
written contract” apply to the word “debt”
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 31 of 48

which may be “with or without interest”. We
therefore, without any hesitation reject this
contention of the appellant."
44.

It would be useful to consider the observations of this court

in the pronouncement reported at 21 (1982) DLT 167 FCI Vs.
Bal Krishan Garg, wherein the court had held thus:"7. What then, is a debt? Relying in Webb Vs.
Stenton, (1883) 11 QBD 518 it was held in
Commissioner of Wealth Tax Vs. Pierce Leslie &
Co. Ltd., AIR 1963 Madras 356, that the essential
requisites of a debt are (1) an ascertained or
readily calculable amount; (2) an absolute
unqualified and present liability in regard to that
amount with the obligation to pay forthwith or in
future within a time certain; (3) the obligation
must have accured and be subsisting and should
not be that which is merely accuring.
A
contingent liability or a contingency debt is,
therefore, neither a liability nor a debt. A debt is
a 'debitum in praesenti, solvendum in futuro.'
We, therefore, hold that the amount covered by
the suit is an ascertained amount payable under
an unqualified present liability. The obligation
has accrued and subsists. It is a debt accruing
under a written contract. The learned counsel
for the defendant wanted to urge that the words
'arising on a written contract' must be read along
with the word 'interest' and since no interest was
payable under the contract the suit is not covered
by clause (b) of Rule 2 of Order 37 Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908. This is an argument totally
unsupportable. The words 'arising on a written
contact' apply to the word 'debt' which may be
'with or without interest'. We therefore, without
any hesitation reject this contention of the
appellant."

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 32 of 48

45.

It would also be appropriate to advert to the observations of

the High Court of Judicature at Madras in its pronouncement
reported at AIR 1963 Madras 356 which reads thus:"7. Debt is a common expression and it is
difficult to believe that it can give rise to any
controversy in interpreting it. Broadly stated it
is a liquidated money obligation for the recovery
of which an action will lie. It is an ascertained
liquidated quantified obligation enforceable 'in
praesenti' or 'in futuro'. A debt must be a
"debitum" that is due. The fact that the time for
payment will arise in future does not make it
any the less a debt. 'Debitum in praesenti,
solvendum in futuro' - this is not repugnant to
the conception of a debt, because the obligation
is crystallised and it is only the payablity that is
in abeyance, but a debt has to be distinguished
from what can only be described as something
which will probably or partly ripen into a debt.
A future contingent liability is not a debt due
and owing. It is not only not due but being
contingent never may become due. An inchoate
liability with a fair prospect of maturity into a
debt in future and still in its embryo stage would
not answer the description of a debt. Till it is
born it is not a debt. Every kind of liability,
immature, formative and in the course of
evolution to become a debt, cannot be called a
debt in anticipation of the ultimate."
In a later part of the judgment, in para 10, the court held that
a contingent debt is not a debt until the contingency happens. In
para 11 of the pronouncement, essential requisites of the debt were
laid down thus:-

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 33 of 48

"11. .......The essential requisites of a debt are
therefore (1) an ascertained or readily calculable
amount; (2) an absolute unqualified and present
liability in regard to that amount with the
obligation to pay forthwith or in future within a
time certain; (3) the obligation must have
accrued and subsisting and should not be that
which is merely accruing."
46.

So far as the expression 'liquidated demand' is concerned,

the same has been interpreted in AIR 1990 Delhi 278
Rajender Kumar Khanna Vs. OIC, wherein the court held
thus:"3. The industry of counsel had not been able to
produce a single precedent of courts in India,
which explained what is 'liquidated demand'.
However, reference has been made to Words &
Phrases Permanent Edition, in which reference is
made to Rifkin Vs. Safenovitz, 40 A 2d 188. It is
stated that "amount claimed to be due is a
'liquidated demand' within statute authorizing
summary judgments if it is susceptible of being
made certain in amount by mathematical
calculations from factors which are or ought to be
in possession or knowledge of party to be
charged".
xxxx
xxxx

6. As a result of the claim, made by the
petitioner, a surveyor was appointed by the
Insurance Company, who gave a report of
damage in terms of percentage, to the cargo of
dry dates. It is the plaintiff's case that this
damage in percentage is capable, by arithmetical
calculation of being quantified into the amount of
damage actually sustained to the cargo, vis-a-vis
the amount for which they were insured, and,
therefore, the damage in percentage is a
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 34 of 48

'liquidated demand' within the meaning of Order
XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure.
xxxx
xxxx
xxxx
12. In view of the provisions of the insurance
policy, the provisions of item 14 of the Schedule
to the Insurance Act, the provisions of Section
64-UM of the Insurance Act, the percentage loss
suffered to the dry dates as evidenced by the
report of the surveyor, in my view, is capable, by
an arithmetical calculation, of arriving at a
determinable sum, which sum would constitute a
'liquidated demand' within the meaning dicta in
Rifkin Vs. Safenovitz (supra), and the provisions
of Order XXXVII of the Code of Civil Procedure."
In the preceding paragraphs, I have noticed the computation
of the amounts claimed is based on additions and subtractions of
the amounts of the cheques which is enabled by simple
arithmetical calculation ascertainment of the amount payable by
the defendant.
47.

My attention has been drawn to the pronouncement of this

court reported in 67 (1997) DLT 13 Daya Chand Uttam
Prakash Jain Vs. Santosh Devi Sharma.

The court has

extensively considered the law on what would constitute a 'debt'
which is with instructive and apposite and deserves to be
considered in extenso. It was discussed and held thus :“9. In Food Corporation of India Vs. Bal
Krishan Garg, 21 (1982) DLT 167, a
Division Bench of this court considered the
requisites of debt in connection with the suit for
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 35 of 48

recovery of the price of goods. It was held to be
maintainable under Order 37, Code of Civil
Procedure, 1908 by treating the unpaid price as
debt. In regard to 'Debt' following observations
of the Division Bench of this court in para 7 are
relevant here.
"7. What there is a debt? Relying in Webb Vs.
Stenton, (1883) 11 QBD 518 it was held in
Commissioner of Wealth Tax Vs. Pierce Leslie &
Co. Ltd., AIR 1963 Madras 356, that the essential
requisites of a debt are (1) an ascertained or
readily calculable amount; (2)
an absolute
unqualified and present liability in regard to that
amount with the obligation to pay forthwith or in
future within a time certain; (3) the obligation
must have accured and be subsisting and should
not be that which is merely accuring.
A
contingent liability or a contingency debt is,
therefore, neither a liability nor a debt. A debt is
a 'debitum in praesenti, solvendum in futuro.'
We, therefore, hold that the amount covered by
the suit is an ascertained amount payable under
an unqualified present liability. The obligation
has accrued and subsists. It is a debt accruing
under a written contract.”
10. The term "written contract" in the words of
Black's Law Dictionary (6th Ed.) means as under
:
"To "acknowledge" is to admit, affirm, declare,
testify, avow, confess or own as genuine,
Favello v. Bank of America Nat. Trus &
Savings Ass'n, 24 Cal App. 2d 342, 74 P. 2d
1057m 1058. Admission or affirmation of
obligation or responsibility. Weyerhaeuser
Timber co. v. Marshall, C.C.A. Wash., 102
F.2d 78, 81.(sic.) states have adopted the
Uniform Acknowledgment Act.
The debtor's acknowledgement of the creditor's
debt and or right of action that will revive the
enforceability of a debt barred by the statute of
limitations. Part payment of obligation which
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 36 of 48

tolls statute of limitation is a form of
"acknowledgement of debt". In re: Badger's
Estate, 156 Kan. 734. 137 P. 2nd 198, 205."
11.2 According to Stroud's Judicial Dictionary
acknowledgement means as under :
(1). "an acknowledgement, in writing of a
debt...so as to take such debt out of the
Limitation Act....(1) must admit that debt
is due, and (2) promise, or justify the
inference of promise, of payment
unconditionally, or (if conditionally) it
must be shown that the condition has
been accomplished....A statement in a
balance sheet presented to a creditorshareholder of a Company and signed by
the Directors or their agents is sufficient
acknowledgement (Jones v. Bellgrove
Properties, (1949) 2 K.B.700), and an
acknowledgement is within the section if it
indicates that a debt is due, even if it does not
state the amount (Dungate v. Dungate,
(1965) 1 W.L.R. 1577). But a signature on a
balance sheet, notwithstanding that the debt
appeared therein, was held not to be a sufficient
acknowledgement (Consolidated Agencies v.
Bertram,
(1965)
to
be
a
sufficient
acknowledgement by one of the several executors
suffices (ReMacdonald [1897] 2 Ch. 181,
distinguishing Tullick v. Dunn, Ry. & Moo.
416, and Scholey v. Walton, 13 L.J. Ex. 122; see
Astbury v. Astbury, infra). "Acknowledges
the
claim"
(Section
23(4)
means
"acknowledgement the debt or other liquidated
pecuniary amounts" (Good v. Parry, [1963] 2
.W.L.R. 846). "Acknowledgement" (Section 24(1)
means acknowledgement of liability......."
(2) "An acknowledgement of a DEED, or
SPECIALITY, by writing or part payment or part
satisfaction (Civil Procedure Act, 1833 (c.42),
Section 5 will suffice if it contains a clear
admission of the speciality debt (see Moodie v.

144, it was observed as under :
"Their Lordships think that what has been
forgotton is that there are two forms of account
stated. An account stated may only take the form
of a mere acknowledgement of a debt, and in
those circumstances, though it is quite true it
amounts to a promise and the existence of a debt
may be inferred, that can be rebutted, and it may
very well turn out that there in no real debt at all,
and in those circumstances there would be no
consideration and no binding promise.
But on the other hand, there is another form of
account stated which is a very (sic.)form as
between merchants in business in which the
account stated is an account which contains
entries on both sides, and in which the parties
who have stated the account between them have
agreed that the items on one side should be set
against the items upon the other side and the
balance only should be paid; the items on the
smaller side are set off and deemed to be paid by
the items on a larger side, and there is a promise
for good consideration to pay the balance arising
from the fact that the items have been so set off
and paid in the way described."
Their Lordships were further of the view that :
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 38 of 48

"That was done.
The man writes on account which was demanded
by the servant for the express purpose of
knowing what sum he would be entitled to get
and which, it seems to their Lordships, was
stated by the Managing Partner of the business,
for the sole purpose of enabling the servant to
know what his final remuneration was to be. To
make quite clear that it was intended to express
something in the nature of an obligation he
authenticated the document and that can be the
only effect of that particular part of the
transaction-by writing his signature over two 10
cent stamps.
In their Lordships' view, that was a plain case of
a promise made to pay the balance for a good
consideration. One cannot help thinking that if
an account stated in those circumstances did not
give rise in Kenya to the promise to pay, and for a
good consideration, Kenya would be certainly
without one of the most ordinary business
facilities which has been common to everybody
who carries on business under any system which
incorporates any of the ordinary principles of
English contract law."(Emphasis supplied)
11.4 In Gharabharan v. Sri Radha Kishan
& Ors., AIR 1958 All.313, a Division Bench of
the Allahabad High Court about 'account' stated
as under :
"(12)...Where the accounts contain a series
of cross-entries, one evidencing payment of
loans advanced at various times by the creditor
and the other evidencing payment of amounts
paid towards the same loans at various times by
the debtor, and the parties agree to set one series
of entries against the other and after doing the
same, finally arrive at an agreed balance,
the final settlement of accounts thus
made constitutes an "account stated."
That fact that both the entries relate to the same
transaction of loan does not take the transaction
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 39 of 48

out of the category of "account stated", nor does
it make the transaction a unilateral one. Such a
transaction is really a bilateral one as both the
parties have met together and after mutual
accounting in respect of the advances made by
the one and payments made by the other have
finally agreed by a joint application of their
minds to treat a certain specific figure as the
amount due on that date. Both the parties
participating in this transaction have
combined in finally adjusting their
rights.
They have jointly co-operated in wiping off their
previous or antecedent rights and liabilities and
substituting therefor a new or a fresh right and
liability. The procedure of surrender and
discharge involved in such a transaction
for the purpose of arriving at an agreed
settlement is truly a bilateral one. The
process of "give and take" which such a
transaction demands from either side,
itself constitute a sufficient consideration
which is enough to sustain the fresh
agreement as valid in law.
Reference in this connection might be made to
the case of Bishnu Chand v. Girdhari Lal,
AIR 1934 All.LJ 623 : ILR 56, All 376 : (AIR 1934
PC 147 (A) in which their Lordships of the Privy
Council have expounded the law in this regard.
Then such an "account stated" is signed by the
party sought to be made liable or its duly
authorised agent, the "account stated" as
envisaged in Art. 64 is created. Such an "account
stated" gives rise to a new cause of action and a
suit brought within three years of the date of
such a cause of action is not barred by limitation.
Such a suit cannot be thrown out on the ground
that some of the items intecedent to the date of
the "account stated" were barred by limitation.
Previous rights and liabilities having been swept
away by the concerted and agreed Will and action
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 40 of 48

of parties themselves, the previous items which
formed the material for arriving at the agreed
figure must, for the purposes of the suit, be
eliminated from consideration, and a fresh cause
of action be deemed to be born on the date on
which such a transaction is entered into. In such
a situation, it is not open to the Court to reopen
the closed transaction and to scrutinise the
antecedent entries for the purpose of applying
the bar of limitation. Such a procedure would be
the very negation of the real purpose of "account
stated" and would constitute a violation of
fundamental principles underlying the legal
doctrine of "account stated".
In the present case, there is also no manner of
doubt that this "account stated" was signed by a
partner of the firm. Every partner of a firm has
in law an inherent right to do it, and must,
therefore, be presumed to act as such."

11. It was said that it has not been pleaded that
the suit is based on a written contract. This is
not required by any provision of law. The Court
has to find out whether the suit has been brought
upon a negotiable instrument or a written
contract or an enactment should guarantee to
which Order 37, C.P.C. applies.
The
acknowledgement of Rs.1,00,000/- by the
defendants for the purposes allotment of shares
as application money therefore clearly amounts
to a contract. Because it is their own case that
the plaintiff paid allotment of shares and they
accepted it. There was “consensus of mind”.
And “consensus of mind” leads to a contract, as
Lord Caizns siad. (Cundy v. Lindsay, (1878) 3
App. Case 459 (2) at p. 465). There was promise.
There was consideration. There was acceptance.
All the elements essential for the formation of the
contract are present. What more is needed to
make a contract. It was not a nudum pactum.”

48.

From the foregoing, it is evident that the balance sheets of

the defendant company clearly amounted to acknowledgement of
debt in the light of the principles laid down in the foregoing
judgments.

In Daya Chand Uttam Prakash Jain Vs.

Santosh Devi Sharma (supra), this court has held that 'an
acknowledgement' would amount to 'written contract' and that
acknowledgement implies present liability with an obligation to
pay.

Such written acknowledgement satisfies all essential

elements of a written contract.
I therefore, find force in the submission on behalf of the
plaintiff that the suit based on the balance sheets of the defendantcompany would by itself be maintainable and covered under clause
2 (b) (i) of Rule 1 of Order 37 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
49.

There can be no dispute that the reliance by the plaintiff on

the Memorandum of Understanding dated 1st April, 2004 would
also be covered under the same clause of Order 37 in as much as
such Memorandum of Understanding would constitute a written
contract.

Undoubtedly, in the instant case, the defendant has

failed to abide by the Memorandum of Understanding resulting in
the plaintiff being entitled to submit that the same was not binding
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 42 of 48

on its very terms.
50.

Learned counsel for the defendant has placed reliance on the

pronouncement of the Apex Court reported in 1970 (21) FLR
387 Management of Consolidated Coffee Estate Ltd. Vs.
The Workmen to support the defendant's submission that it was
entitled to the leave to defend the suit. I find that in this case the
issue raised before this court was whether the workmen were
entitled to bonus.

The workmen had placed reliance on the

amount so reflected in the profit and loss account and balance
sheet of the company. In the facts of the case, the court arrived at
a conclusion that the company could not have known the amount
of bonus it ultimately would have to pay while preparing its
balance sheet for the year in question and that the amount shown
as bonus in its balance sheet and profit and loss account for the
year in question could therefore, be at best an estimated amount.
For this reason, the amount reflected as bonus was held not to be
an admission of liability to pay.
In the instant case, there is no estimate involved in the
amount reflected by the company as its owings to other persons
and the admission of the amount is clear and unequivocal.
51.

In (1983) 3 SCC 410 Central Bureau of Investigation

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 43 of 48

Vs. V.C. Shukla & Ors., the court was considering the probative
value of entries in the books of accounts. Furthermore, the court
considered the entries made by certain persons in notebooks. The
court had held that such entries were in the nature of statements
which could be treated as an admission against the accused
persons provided that they related to any fact in issue or to a
relevant fact.
So far as the books of accounts were concerned, the court
had stated that the rationale behind the law of admissibility of
books of accounts is that the regularity of habit, the difficulty of
falsification and the fair certainty of ultimate detection give them
in a sufficient degree a probability of trustworthiness. Since there
is an element of self-interest and partisanship of the entrant to
make a person liable, behind whose back and without whose
knowledge, the entry is made, an additional safeguard of
insistence upon other independent evidence to fasten him with
such liability has been provided in Section 34 of the Evidence Act.
These observations were made in a criminal prosecution
wherein the prosecution was relying on diaries and records made
by accused persons against other co-accused.
In the instant case, the entries in the books of account are
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 44 of 48

duly corroborated in the balance sheets as well as in the
admissions of the

defendant in its correspondence with the plaintiff as also the aforenoticed Memorandum of Understanding dated 1st April, 2004.
Therefore, such corroboration as is envisaged under Section 34 of
the Indian Evidence Act is also available.
52.

So far as the pronouncement of this court reported in 2004

(76) DRJ 32 Krishna Finhold Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Gupta & Co. &
Anr. is concerned, this case is distinguishable on facts from the
present case.

Before this court, there is no ambiguity in the

amount payable by the defendant in the light of the statements
made in the several documents noticed hereinabove. In Krishna
Finhold Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Gupta & Co. & Anr., the terms of the
loan as to the period for which the loan was granted and other
material terms of the agreement were not clear and for this reason,
the court was of the view that leave to defend is granted to the
defendant. There is no such issue in the present case.
53.

So far as the grant of leave to defend to a defendant in a suit

under Order 37 is concerned, the principles which would guide the
court are well settled. In this behalf, reliance can be placed on the
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 45 of 48

pronouncement of the Apex Court in (1958) SCR 1211 Santosh
Kumar Vs. Mool Singh, wherein the court summed up the
principles thus:“(a) If the defendant satisfied the Court that he
has a good defence to the claim on merits, the
defendant is
entitled to unconditional leave to defend.
(b) If the defendant raises a triable issue
indicating that
he has a fair or bonafide or reasonable defence,
although not a possibly good defence, the
defendant is entitled to unconditional leave to
defend.
(c) If the defendant discloses such facts as may
be deemed sufficient to entitle him to defend,
that is, if the affidavit discloses that at the trial he
may be able to establish a defence to the
plaintiff's claim, the court may impose
conditions at the time of granting leave to defend
the conditions being as to time of trial or mode of
trial but not as to payment into court or
furnishing security.
(d) If the defendant has no defence, or if the
defence is sham or illusory or practically
moonshine, the defendant is not entitled to leave
to defend.
(e) If the defendant has no defence or the
defence is
illusory or sham or practically moonshine, the
court may show mercy to the defendant by
enabling him to try to prove a defence but at the
same time protect the plaintiff imposing the
condition that the amount claimed should be
paid into court or otherwise secured.”

CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 46 of 48

54.

These principles were reiterated by the Apex Court in JT

1998 (3) SC 341 M/s Sunil Enterprises & Anr. Vs. SBI
Commercial and International Bank Ltd.
55.

The defendants have admitted liability in the balance sheets,

correspondence and the Memorandum of Understanding.

The

plaintiff has filed a detailed affidavit clearly setting out the owings
of the defendants. No other payment is claimed by the defendants.
There is also no material dispute nor any issue to the payments
made by the plaintiff to the defendants.
56.

So far as interest is concerned, there is no claim of pre-suit

interest. The plaintiff has prayed for pendente lite and future
interest at the rate of 18% per annum. It is well settled that the
power to grant pendente lite and future interest vests in the court
under Section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure and certainly there
can be no prohibition to the maintainability of the present suit on
the ground that the plaintiff has incorporated a prayer for
pendente lite and future interest.
In the instant case, I have no manner of doubt that the
defendant has failed to raise the triable issue or that he has a fair
or bonafide or reasonable defence to the case of the plaintiff. The
defendant has not disclosed any such fact which could be
CS(OS) No. 542/2004

page 47 of 48

considered sufficient to entitle him to leave to defend the present
suit.

In fact, the case of the plaintiff is established from the

documents executed by the defendant itself. There is therefore no
merit in the present application.
57.

In the light of the above, it has to be held that the objections

of the defendant are wholly without merit and the defence
disclosed in support of the leave to defend do not require
adjudication.
These principles clearly apply to the defence raised by the
defendant which consequently deserves to be rejected.
I therefore, find no merit in the case by the defendant in this
application and consequently, the present application is hereby
dismissed.
