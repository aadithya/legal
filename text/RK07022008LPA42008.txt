DR. MUKUNDAKAM SHARMA, CJ. (ORAL)

1.

This appeal is directed against the order dated 03.09.2007 passed by the

learned Single Judge dismissing the writ petition filed by the appellant challenging
the legality of the concurrent findings of fact and orders passed by the Apparel
Export Promotion Council; the Appellate Textile Commissioner and the Second
Appellate Committee constituted to decide grievances by the Central Government,
Ministry of Textiles.
2.

The appellant herein was allocated a quota in terms of the Garment Export

LPA 4/2008

Page 1 of 4

Policy prevalent in 1997. At the relevant time, garment exports were entitled to
benefits/schemes such as Past Performance Entitlement, Past Performance
Transfer, First Come First Served, Non-Quota Entitlement and New Investment
Entitlement, etc.

The aforesaid schemes which were made available by the

Central Government enabled exporters to obtain a number of concessions/quota.
In terms of such schemes, if an exporter completed his obligations before 30 th of
September of the concerned calendar year, he was unconditionally eligible to
benefits without submission of legal undertakings or bank guarantees. In the
present case, the appellant was allotted quota under country/category during the
year 1997 and because of short shipment, the competent authority forfeited an
amount of Rs.3,54,130/- by issuing an order on 10.07.1998. Against the aforesaid
order dated 10.07.1998, the appellant preferred an appeal before the Textile
Commissioner, who dismissed the appeal under order dated 31.08.2001.
3.

Being aggrieved by the said order, further appeal was taken to the Second

Appellate Tribunal, which was again dismissed by order dated 28th October, 2003.
Against the said order, a writ petition was filed which was also accordingly
dismissed as stated hereinbefore and hence the present appeal, on which we have
heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties and have also gone through the
records. There is a concurrent finding of facts of the three authorities, namely, the
primary authority as also the first appellate authority and the second appellate
authority, that the appellant could not manufacture the garments and export the
same and the same could not be processed within the stipulated time. The defence
that was taken by the appellant for explaining his problem in not making supply
within time was that there were unforeseen factors, namely, labour problems at the
processor's unit and subsequently at his own unit and, therefore, there was delay in

LPA 4/2008

obtaining fabrics and manufacturing which in turn resulted in short utilisation of
the quota.
4.

The aforesaid three authorities on appreciation of the records available

before them held that the aforesaid defence of unforeseen factors, namely, labour
problems at the processor's unit is not a valid defence and cannot be used as a
shield of defence because no such documentary evidence was produced before the
primary authority as also before the first appellate authority. Such certificates as
are being relied upon subsequently appear to have been produced for the first time
before the second appellate authority. The said documents also indicate that the
processor's unit was allegedly closed from 18.09.1977 and that even thereafter, the
appellant got the said revalidation done on 01.10.1997.
5.

Another defence that was sought to be raised was that even the appellant's

unit was closed from 17.11.1997 to 23.12.1997. It is not clear from the records as
to whether the documents pertaining thereto were even placed before the second
appellate authority. Be that as it may, the said documents were also taken notice
by the learned Single Judge and on appreciation thereof he has held that the said
documents would not be relevant because even if there was some problem in the
unit of the appellant, he could have got the said garments processed and made in
some other unit, if he was interested in doing so.
6.

There are thus concurrent findings of fact and this Court sitting on the

appellate side should not and would not reappreciate the evidence and the
concurrent findings of facts arrived at. There is apparently a default on the part of
the appellant to meet the requirement and the stipulation in terms of the
obligations cast on him under the Garment Export Entitlement Policy, which he
could not met. Revalidation of quota was sought for even after the period during

LPA 4/2008

Page 3 of 4

which it was stated that the processor's unit was closed for labour unrest. The
strike of the unit of the processor occurred on 18.09.1997 whereas the revalidation
was done on 01.10.1997, knowing fully well the implications and obligations
thereof. From 01.10.1997, there was total non-action on the part of the appellant,
although on record a document is placed to show that there was some labour
problem in the appellant's unit also from 17.11.1997 to 23.12.1997.
7.

Considering the facts and circumstances of the case, we find no infirmity in

the order passed by the learned Single Judge. The appeal has no merits and is
dismissed. CM Nos.144-45/2008 also stand dismissed.
