1.

This writ petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India

has been preferred by the petitioner seeking quashing of impugned
order dated 4.02.2008 passed by Industrial Tribunal in Approval
Application (OP) No.518/1993.
2.

The

services

of

the

petitioner

were

terminated

by

the

respondent/management in the year 1993 and an application under
Section 33(2) (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, seeking approval from
the appropriate Industrial Tribunal was filed. On 21.3.2001, the
Industrial Tribunal concluded that the enquiry conducted by the
management was vitiated. It permitted the management to prove its
case before the court by leading evidence. After the management

WP(C) No.1532/2008

had examined its witness, the matter was then posted for the
workman's evidence. Ultimately on 14.8.2002, the management's
application, seeking approval under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial
Disputes

Act,

came

to

be

dismissed

because

there

was

no

appearance on its behalf, and also for non-payment of costs of
Rs.300/- that had been imposed upon it by that court. This order was
impugned by the management before this Court in Writ Petition (C)
No.3904/2004. On 5.12.2006, this Court allowed the said writ petition.
Consequently, the order dated 14.8.2002 passed by the Labour Court
was set aside and that Court was directed to proceed with the matter
and dispose of the management's application under Section 33(2)(b)
of the Industrial Disputes Act, seeking approval of the dismissal of the
workman, on merits. On remand, on 23.2.2007, the Industrial Tribunal
posted the matter for recording of evidence of the respondent/
management. Although the workman sought, and was granted, a
number of adjournments for this purpose, he failed to carry out the
cross examination. Ultimately, on 28.11.2007, the Labour Court
closed the opportunity of the workman to cross examine the
management's witness. The workman then moved an application
before the Labour Court praying that since evidence of the
management stood closed even before the matter went up to the
High Court, from where it has now been remanded, the evidence of
the management witness recorded after the remand, be not read, or
treated as part of the record and/ or to allow petitioner to cross
examine the management witness. This application was disposed of
by the impugned order of 04.02.2008, whereby one final opportunity
was given to the petitioner to cross examine the management
witness.

Before me, counsel for the petitioner-workman has sought to

explain away the fact that after the order of the Industrial Tribunal
dated 23.2.2007 directing the matter to be put up on 16.3.2007 for
evidence of the management, the management witness, namely, Sh.
G. K. Sharma was also duly examined without any objection by the
petitioner and the matter has been specifically posted, at the request
of the petitioner himself, for cross examination of the management's
witness by the explanation that through all this time, and over all
these hearings, he was not aware that this procedural error has been
committed, and for that reason he did not take this objection earlier.
He states that this was sufficient ground for setting aside or
modifying the order passed by the Labour Court on 23.2.2007 and
that for this reason alone, the learned Court ought to have granted
this prayer. Petitioner's counsel states that he became aware of this
procedural error for the first time only towards the end of January,
2008 when he inspected the file after the closure of the opportunity
to cross-examine the management's witness by the aforesaid order
dated 28.11.2007, which he wanted to challenge.
4.

The earlier Writ Petition No.3904/2004 setting aside the

dismissal of the respondent's application under Section 33(2) of the
Industrial Disputes Act came to be allowed on 5.12.2006.

By that

order, parties were directed to appear before the Labour Court on
10.1.2007. Pursuant to this order, it appears that the workman, who is
the petitioner before me, himself moved an application on 10.1.2007
informing the Labour Court of this Court's order in the writ petition.
Along with that application, he annexed a certified copy of the order
of this Court dated 5.12.2006. Therefore, there can be no doubt that
the petitioner was fully aware of the terms of the order dated
WP(C) No.1532/2008

Page 3 of 7

5.12.2006 passed by this Court. Furthermore, the order sheet
pertaining to the proceedings held before the Labour Court on
10.1.2007 has not been annexed by the petitioner in these
proceedings.
5.

According to counsel for the petitioner, after a couple of

adjournments on account of the absence of the Presiding Officer, the
matter thereafter came up on 23.2.2007, when the Labour Court
directed the matter to be put on 16.3.2007 for evidence of the
management. This order was passed in the presence of proxy counsel
for the petitioner. Be that as it may, the fact that the petitioner
himself had filed the order of this Court dated 5.12.2006 on 10.1.2007
before the Labour Court, cannot be lost sight of. Similarly, the order
of 23.2.2007 directing the matter to be put on 16.3.2007 for evidence
of the management cannot also be said to have been passed without
the knowledge of the petitioner. Thereafter, it appears that the
evidence of the management witness was duly recorded and number
of opportunities were also granted to the petitioner to cross-examine
the said witness produced by the management.
6.

However, the petitioner failed to cross-examine the witness and

consequently on 28.11.20007, when yet another adjournment was
requested by the petitioner on the plea that his counsel was
unavailable, the Labour Court thought fit to close his opportunity for
cross-examination. From a copy of the order sheet dated 28.11.2007
placed by the petitioner on the record, it appears that the Labour
Court was also constrained to impose costs on the petitioner.
Although the petitioner has not bothered to attach copies of the
relevant order sheets which might indicate the reason that prompted
Labour Court to impose these costs, it appears that they were
WP(C) No.1532/2008

Page 4 of 7

imposed due to the failure of the petitioner to cross-examine the
management witness despite repeated opportunities.
7.

In substance what emerges is as follows:-

(i)

That the Labour Court allowed the Delhi Transport Corporation

to examine another witness namely Mr.G.K.Sharma, although, its
evidence had already been closed earlier.
(ii)

Although this order permitting the corporation to examine its

witness was passed in the presence of the petitioner, there was no
objection taken by him.
(iii)

Although repeated opportunities were sought by the petitioner

to cross examine that witness, which was duly granted, he failed to
utilise them.
(iv)

Ultimately, the right to cross examine the witness was closed.

(v)

It was only thereafter that the petitioner decided to challenge

the order permitting the corporation to examine its witness.
Learned counsel for the petitioner has not been able to show any
authority for the proposition that under such circumstances, it is open
to the petitioner to challenge the order permitting the corporation to
examine its witness.
8.

The power of a Court to recall a witness or to direct the

examination of any witness at any stage of a trial or even in appeal, is
well known.

While the petitioner may be correct that the

management's evidence was already over and there was no formal
application by it for examination of any fresh witness, there has been
clear acquiescence by the petitioner to the order dated 23rd February,
2007 directing examination of Mr. G. K. Sharma.

Not only was it

passed in the presence of the petitioner who had himself tendered a
copy of this Court's order in the writ petition; he never took any
WP(C) No.1532/2008

Page 5 of 7

objection to this order even later on. On the contrary, the petitioner
allowed the management to examine Mr. G. K. Sharma and kept
seeking adjournments to cross examine him; even going to the extent
of suffering an order to pay costs for this purpose. It was only when
his opportunity to cross examine was finally closed and counsel for
the petitioner inspected the file to assail the order closing his chance
to cross examine the said witness, that it dawned upon counsel that
he could very well have objected to the Labour Court granting the
management an opportunity to produce further evidence. To my
mind, the maxim 'Vigilantibus, et non dormientibus, jura
subveniunt' i.e., the vigilant, and not the sleepy, are assisted by the
laws, applies to the facts of the present case. Furthermore, the
conduct of the petitioner thereafter is clear acquiescence of the
decisions of the Labour Court dated 10.1.2007 and 23.2.2007. In any
case, by its order of 4.2.2008 which is impugned before me, the
Labour Court has granted yet another opportunity to the petitioner to
cross examine that witness. It would be open to the petitioner to elicit
the truth from him or to discredit him. I do not see any miscarriage of
justice in the matter, nor do I find any perversity in the impugned
matter that would persuade this Court to exercise its writ jurisdiction.
9.

Under the circumstances, and especially in view of the fact that

repeated opportunities were granted to the petitioner to crossexamine the witness, and even thereafter, by way of the impugned
order passed on 4.2.2008, the Labour Court has granted yet another
opportunity to cross-examine the witness after recalling its order
dated 28.11.2007 by which the right to cross-examine was closed; I
do not find any infirmity in the order calling for interference by this
Court in the exercise of writ jurisdiction.
