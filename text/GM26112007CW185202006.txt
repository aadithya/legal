1.

This writ petitioner is the erstwhile owner of the property

comprising khasra no.356 measuring about 1 bigha situated at
the Magazine Road, Khyber Pass, Delhi. He was having a trade
licence at this premises with a sanctioned electricity connection
and was carrying on the business of an auto repair workshop
therefrom.

It is an admitted position that the petitioner was

dispossessed from this property when possession of the site
was taken over by the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. The DMRC
WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.1

has claimed to have taken possession of the land including the
site of the petitioner on 15th February, 2000.
2.

The petitioner places reliance on a circular dated 21st

January, 2002 issued by the Government of NCT of Delhi,
Transport Department, wherein in Clause IV, it was stipulated
that cases of project affected shopkeepers as verified by the
concerned ADM/LAC, would be recommended to the DDA for
making alternative allotment of shops at “predetermined
prices” depending upon the availability.
3.

As the petitioner was being deprived allotment of a shop

despite possession of his premises having been taken, the
petitioner filed a writ petition being WP (C) No.853/2003
entitled Shri Qamar Hussain Vs. MCD and Ors. which was
allowed by the court on 1st November, 2004 with directions to
the Land Acquisition Collector to treat the petition as a
representation and to consider the claim of the petitioner under
the circular dated 31st January, 2002.

It was further directed

that in case the Land Acquisition Collector/ADM held in favour of
the petitioner, the necessary recommendation was to be made

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.2

to the DDA in terms of the Clause IV of the circular dated 31st
January, 2002.
In such eventuality, the DDA was directed to proceed to
consider the petitioner’s case for alternative allotment as per
Clause IV of this circular.
4.

So far as the period within which the consideration was

required to be made, the court in the judgment dated 1st
November, 2004, specifically directed that compliance be made
by the Land Acquisition Collector/ADM within a period of six
weeks.

The DDA was directed to proceed to consider

alternative allotment as per the policy within twelve weeks of
the receipt of the recommendation from the Land Acquisition
Collector/ADM. The court further clarified that the stand of the
DDA was that the alternative shop/site to be allotted as per
policy was subject to availability.
5.

It is noteworthy that the court had only noticed the stand

of the DDA that the plot to be allotted as per the policy was
subject to availability of the same.

There was no further

direction to it.

6.

According to the writ petitioner, the period of eight weeks

granted to the Land Acquisition Collector/ADM to consider the
representation of the petitioner, expired on or about 31st
December, 2004.
7.

The

Land

Acquisition

Collector

made

its

favourable

recommendation to the DDA by its communication dated 31st
March, 2005 that “DDA should make alternative allotment of
shops at predetermined rates in terms of the basic guidelines of
Relocation and Rehabilitation Policy in respect of project
affected persons contained in the circular dated 31st January,
2002”.
8.

The

period

of

12

weeks

from

the

date

of

the

recommendations of the ADM-cum-Land Acquisition Collector
thus expired on or about 30th June, 2005.
9.

It appears that the DDA failed to consider the case of the

petitioner in terms of the directions made by this court on 1st
November, 2004 compelling the petitioner to file a petition
seeking initiation of proceedings under the Contempt of Courts

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.4

Act against the DDA. Cont.Case (C) No.74/2006 was thus filed
by the petitioner on 5th January, 2006.

This petition was

disposed of on 20th of March, 2006 by this court in view of the
statement by the counsel for the DDA that he had been
instructed to make a statement that alternative allotment would
be made to the petitioner. It was further stated by the counsel
for the DDA that the petitioner would be given necessary
opportunity to give preferences within four weeks and that
feeding of those preferences at a computerized draw of lot
allotment would be effected within 12 weeks from today.
10. It is thus evident that allotment would thus have matured
in favour of the petitioner within 16 weeks from 20th March,
2006, that is to say, by 20th July, 2006 or thereabouts.
11. There is no dispute before this court that the DDA failed to
give the list of available options to the petitioner within the time
granted which expired on or about the 19th April, 2006.
12. Mr. Rajat Aneja, learned counsel appearing for the
petitioner, has contended that it was with great difficulty and

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.5

pursuasion that the list of shops whreefrom options were to be
exercised was supplied to the petitioner only on 5th June, 2006
which constituted of large number of plots and shops.

The

petitioner was required to ascertain the suitability of the options
given by the respondent and on best efforts, was able to give
the list of his five preferences to the DDA on 19th June, 2006.
13. It appears that even thereafter, despite repeated visits of
the petitioner and expiry of the twenty weeks from 20th March,
2006 granted by the court, no action was taken on the
preferences

submitted

by

the

petitioner.

On

enquiries

conducted by him, the petitioner found that out of his five
preferences, four of the shops were already allotted by the
DDA. It is now stated by DDA that it had conducted draw of lots
on 15th June, 2006 in which four of the shops for which the
petitioner had opted, had been already allotted.

Only one of

the petitioner's preferences remained for allotment.
14. Aggrieved by the failure of the DDA to even comply with
the directions given by the court on 20th of March, 2006, the
petitioner filed CM No.12251/2006 in the contempt proceedings
WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.6

with the prayer that the DDA be restrained for allotting the fifth
shop for which he had opted.
15. It may be noted that the respondent refused to allot this
fifth shop to the petitioner for the reason that it was the only
remaining shop within the preferences was bearing no.74, Block
J, LSC, Vikas Puri, New Delhi. Before this court, the DDA has
taken a stand that as per its policy, allotment of a shop can be
done only by draw of lots to be held between more than one
options and that a single available shop is never allotted to any
particular person.
16. In these circumstances, a second list of possible option
was given by the DDA to the petitioner on 17th August, 2006.
17. The petitioner in the meantime again submitted his
preferences by his communication dated 19th September, 2006.
On the 2nd November, 2006, the respondent sought an
adjournment in the contempt proceedings on the ground that
certain developments have taken place.
18. Thereafter, the petitioner received demand-cum-allotment

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.7

letters dated 16/17th November, 2006 informing the petitioner
that he had been allotted a shop no.82, Pocket L(U), LSC, Pitam
Pura, Delhi on the 3rd Floor at a total value of Rs.5,16,195/-.
The petitioner was informed that he was required to pay
documentation charges of Rs.45/- as well and make payment of
the demanded amount by 16th December, 2006.
19. It is noteworthy that the DDA had given vacant list of draw
of lots for the old and undisposed inventory to the petitioner on
17th August, 2006 wherein the cost of this very unit was
mentioned as Rs.3,38,250/-.

It is apparent therefore that the

cost of this property on 17th August, 2006 according the DDA
was Rs.3,38,250/- and that after a period of about three months
for the same property, the DDA was demanding an amount of
Rs.5,16,195/-.
20. The petitioner had objected to this demand letter on the
ground that the same was issued after a prolonged and
inordinate delay as a result of which the respondent was
charging excessive cost. According to the petitioner, the cost
payable by him could only be Rs.3,38,250/- as had been
WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.8

indicated in the list given to the petitioner.
21. These objections to the cost were raised in the contempt
proceedings on the ground that the demand-cum-allotment
letter had been issued after a prolonged and inordinate delay
and that the same was exorbitant and excessive. However, the
court was of the view that the issue as to whether the cost was
excessive or not, could not be gone into in the contempt
proceedings. Consequently, the contempt petition was disposed
of reserving liberty to the petitioner to initiate substantive
proceedings if so advised.
22. In these circumstances, this writ petition has thereafter
been filed by the petitioner challenging the demand raised by
the DDA in its demand-cum-allotment letter dated 16th/17th
November, 2006 by way of the present writ petition.
23. On the very first day when the writ petition came up for
hearing on 13th December, 2006, an interim order was passed
directing that, subject to the petitioner making a without
prejudice deposit of Rs.3,38,250/-, on or before the expiry of
16th December, 2006, the last date for depositing the amount in
WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.9

terms of the demand-cum-allotment letter, the DDA would
stand restrained from cancelling the allotment.
The petitioner is stated to have deposited that amount as
directed.
24. Before this court, the basic ground of challenge to the
demand is based on the fact that the DDA had failed to comply
with the directions made by this court as back as on 1 st
November, 2004 whereby the DDA was required to comply with
the allotment process on or before the 30th June, 2005.

Mr.

Rajat Aneja, learned counsel for the petitioner, has pointed out
that such allotment has been effected by the letters dated 1617th November, 2006 for which delay, the petitioner cannot be
prejudiced.
25. On the other hand, Ms. Sangeeta Chandra, learned counsel
appearing for the DDA, has contended that the demand-cumallotment letter dated 16-17th November, 2006 has been issued
in accordance with the resolution no.69/2002 governing the
pricing of inventory of built up shops. According to the DDA, by

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.10

a letter of the Commissioner (Land) dated 10th May, 2005, the
petitioner was required to submit a copy of the court order in
WP (C) No.853/2003 as well as the documents relating to land
acquired for processing the case for allotment.

The DDA

submits that these documents were furnished only in a public
hearing held on 5th June, 2006 and consequently no delay was
attributable to the DDA.
26. It is admitted by the DDA that out of the inventory of old
and indisposed unit given to the petitioner on 5th June, 2006,
some of the shops had already been allotted. Consequently, a
final list was given to the petitioner out of which he submitted
his preferences on 17th September, 2006. In this background,
the petitioner was considered for allotment of the shop in the
draw of lots held on 11th October, 2006.
As a result, according to the learned counsel for the DDA,
the demand letter was correctly issued on 16th/17th November,
2006 for the sum of Rs.5,16,195/-. According to the DDA, as
per the resolution no.69/2002, the date of draw has to form the

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.11

basis of pricing in all cases of allotment made from old and
indisposed inventory.
27. So far as the variation in the cost of the shop in question is
concerned, according to the DDA, the prices for the old and
undisposed inventory were revised from Rs.9,830/- per sq.meter
to Rs.15,000/- per sq. meter with the approval of Vice-Chairman
of the DDA dated 21st September, 2006.

The basis of this

revision has been explained that these units were lastly
included in an open tender in February, 2003 and the reserve
price of Rs.9,830/- was fixed in the year 2001. It was in this
background that considering increased average auction rate
and the market trend, the price fixation committee was of the
view that reserve prices deserved to be increased and
recommended that the same be increased to Rs.15,000/- per
sq. meter. The recommendation dated 24th August, 2006 of the
price fixation committee was approved by the Vice-Chairman of
the DDA on 21st September, 2006.

Ms. Sangeeta Chandra,

learned standing counsel for the DDA has contended that in
these circumstances, the demand made vide the letter dated

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.12

16th/17th November, 2006 is both justified and correct.
28. These assertions on behalf of the DDA are required to be
considered against the factual background placed before this
court.
29. From the above discussion and the record, I find that there
is no explanation whatsoever as to why the directions made by
this court on 1st November, 2004 were not complied with by the
DDA.

These directions had mandated that the allotment in

favour of the petitioner, if recommended by the land acquisition
collector, be complied with within a period of twelve weeks of
the recommendation.

It is an admitted position that the

recommendation dated 31st March, 2005, was received by the
DDA, yet the period of twelve weeks granted to it was permitted
to expire on or about 30th June, 2005. The DDA had admittedly
taken no action at all in the matter compelling the petitioner to
even file a petition seeking initiation of proceedings under the
Contempt of Courts Act by way of Cont.Cas.(C) No.74/2006. The
petition seeking initiation of the contempt proceeding was filed
on the 5th January, 2006. Even the filing of this petition also did
WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.13

not move the respondent to take action.

Mr. Rajat Aneja,

learned counsel for the petitioner, has pointed out that the DDA
failed to file even a counter affidavit within three months in
these proceedings.
30. Before this court, the DDA has placed reliance on a
communication dated 15th May, 2005 purportedly sent by the
Commissioner

(Land)

to

the

petitioner

calling

upon

the

petitioner to make available copy of the order passed and
documents in support of the acquisition.
The petitioner has disputed receipt of any such letter.
31. Perusal of the note sheet filed by the DDA shows that the
DDA has in its notings required the petitioner to submit copy of
the court order and other relevant documents in support of the
land acquired. It is noteworthy that the noting of the DDA itself
records that the case of the petitioner stands recommended by
the Land Acquisition Collector.
32. The DDA has placed before this court a copy of the letter
dated 15th May, 2005 wherein this request was made to him.
The address as reflected on the letter, is the address of those
WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.14

premises of the petitioner, which according to the petitioner,
were acquired and possession whereof was taken by the Delhi
Metro Rail Corporation as back as in the year 2000. Certainly,
this letter could never have been served upon the petitioner at
the address to which it was sent.
33. My attention has been drawn to the address of the
petitioner as appears in the memo of parties of the WP (C)
No.853/2003.

The petitioner has contended that this was his

address even in the contempt proceedings. There is no dispute
that the DDA has contested the writ petition of 2003 as well as
the contempt proceedings. The DDA thus had available with it
the correct address of the petitioner. There is no justification
for sending such letter in this manner.
34. Furthermore, DDA's reliance on the request for documents
as contained in this letter, is to be noticed only for the sake of
rejection.

Even assuming that the DDA had genuinely required

copies of such documents, nothing precluded its officers from
taking steps to obtain such documents from the counsel who
contested the case on their behalf.

WP (C) No.18520/2006

So far as the documents

Page No.15

relating to the acquisition were concerned, the DDA had before
it the recommendation by the Land Acquisition Collector and
such record could have been obtained from the office of the
Land Acquisition Collector. No such action was taken.
35. The notings dated 3rd March, 2006 and 7th March, 2007 on
the DDA record show that even after receiving notices of the
contempt petition which would have included copy of the order
passed by this court, no action towards compliance thereof was
made. The officers have only noted that court be informed that
the documents had not been furnished by the party.

Other

notings also reflect merely file pushing without any efforts to
comply with the directions made by this court as back as on 1st
November, 2004.
36. Ms. Sangeeta Chandra, learned counsel for the DDA, has
placed reliance on the pronouncement of this court in AIR
1995 SC 1 Delhi Development Authority Vs. Pushpendra
Kumar Jain to contend that the price of the property as on
date of the draw of lot would prevail. Reliance is also placed on
the pronouncement of this court in 1983 (1) SCC 305 D.S.

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.16

Nakara & Others Vs. Union of India to submit that the cut
off date so far as the cost is concerned, as fixed by the DDA
would bind the parties.

The DDA also places reliance on the

judicial pronouncement reported at 129 (2006) DLT 278
(Vol.12). Society for Re-allotments Vs. Chairman, DDA.
37. There can certainly be no dispute with the legal principles
laid down in these judgments.
38. It is well settled that a decision has to be applied in the
facts and circumstances of the case. In this behalf, in JT 2002
(1) SC 485 Haryana Financial Corporation Vs. Jagdamba
Oil Mills, the Apex Court held thus:“19. Courts should not place reliance on decisions
without discussing as to how the factual situation fits
in with the fact situation of the decision on which
reliance is placed. Observations of Courts are not to
be read as Euclid's theorems nor as provisions of the
statute. These observations must be read in the
context in which they appear. Judgments of courts
are not to be construed as statutes. To interpret
words, phrases and provisions of a statute, it may
become necessary for judges to embark into lengthy
discussions but the discussion is meant to explain and
not to define. Judges interpret statutes, they do not
interpret judgments. They interpret words of statutes,
their words are not to be interpreted as statutes. In
London Graving Dock Co. Ltd. v. Horton [1951 AC 737
at P. 761], Lord Mac Dermot observed:
WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.17

“The matter cannot, of course, be settled merely by
treating the ipsissima vertra of Willes, J. as though
they were part of an Act of Parliament and applying
the rules of interpretation appropriate thereto. This is
not to detract from the great weight to be given to the
language actually used by that most distinguished
judge.”
In Home Office v. Dorset Yacht Co. [1970 (2) AII ER
294] Lord Reid said, “Lord Atkin's speech....... is not to
be treated as if it was a statute definition. It will
require qualification in new circumstances.” Megarry,
J. in (1971) 1 WLR 1062 observed: “One must not, of
course, construe even a reserved judgment of even
Russell L.J. as if it were an Act of Parliament.” And, in
Herrington v. British Parliament Board, [(1972) 2 WLR
537] Lord Morris said:
“There is always peril in treating the words of a
speech or judgment as though they are words in a
legislative enactment, and it is to be remembered that
judicial utterances made in the setting of the facts of a
particular case.”
Circumstantial flexibility, one additional or different
fact may make a world of difference between
conclusions in two cases. Disposal of cases by blindly
placing reliance on a decision is not proper.”
39. The judgments relied upon by the respondents, have to be
applied in the facts noticed hereinabove.
40. So far as the challenge to cost of the shop allotted to the
petitioner is concerned, there is no dispute that at the time the

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.18

DDA communicated the inventory of shops for the first time to
the petitioner on 17th August, 2006, so far as the shop which
was finally allotted to the petitioner is concerned, its cost was
reflected as only Rs.3,38,250/-. This list which was furnished to
the petitioner on 17th August, 2006, was almost two years after
the passing of the order dated 1st November, 2004. There is no
dispute that this shop was available for allotment at all times,
even at the time the judgment dated 1st November, 2004 was
passed in favour of the petitioner and on 31st March, 2005 when
the Land Acquisition Collector recommended the case of the
petitioner.

The same shop was available for allotment even

when the petitioner was constrained to file Cont.Cas (C)
No.74/2006 on 5th January, 2006 and on 20th March, 2006 when
this court passed orders directing the DDA to furnish the list of
options within four weeks.
41. The DDA has failed to render any explanations as to why
the directions made even on 20th March, 2006 to make
available a list to the petitioner within four weeks i.e. on or

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.19

before the 19th April, 2006 were not complied with. If the DDA
had complied with the order made on 1st November, 2004, the
allotment in favour of the petitioner would have stood effected
on or before 30th June, 2005.
42. The DDA has taken a stand that the delay which was
caused by it in not complying with the order dated 1st
November, 2004, was condoned by this court when it passed
the order on 20th March, 2006.

Even if this contention was

accepted, the DDA was still bound to give the list of available
preferences to the petitioner within four weeks and make
allotment within 12 weeks thereafter which time expired on or
about 20th June, 2006. The DDA admittedly failed to intimate
the list within the stipulated period and handed over the list of
available preferences to the petitioner only on 5th June, 2006.
The petitioner admittedly communicated his options shortly
thereafter on the 19th of June, 2006. However, without waiting
for exercise of options by the petitioner, the DDA conducted a
draw of lots on 15th June, 2006 in which it allotted four out of

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.20

the

five

shops

for

which

the

petitioner

had

given

his

preferences.
The petitioner was given no intimation that a draw of these
shops was scheduled on 15th of June, 2006.
43. In this background, certainly it cannot be contended that
the DDA had acted fairly. It cannot prejudice a person waiting
for allotment of a property for delays which have occurred on
account of its own actions and faults. In the instant case, the
DDA has failed to even abide by the specific directions of this
court firstly on 1st November, 2004 and again on 20th March,
2006. Even the pendency of the contempt proceedings did not
deter the DDA from acting fairly. Court orders have not moved
it either.
44. It is noteworthy that reliance has been placed on a
communication dated 15th June, 2005 (referred to as 10th May,
2005) to urge that the DDA could not comply with the directions
of this court for the reason that the petitioner did not furnish
documents.
45. Mr. Rajat Aneja, learned counsel for the petitioner, has
WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.21

pointed out that no such plea was raised by the DDA on any
occasion prior hitherto. This plea has been raised for the first
time in these proceedings. Even in the contempt proceedings,
the DDA had not raised such a plea. In any case, I have found
that the copy of the letter filed before this court reflects the
address of the petitioner as that of the property which had
admittedly been acquired by the DMRC and possession taken
also as back as in 2000.
46. In this background, it has to be held that the rights of the
petitioner, so far as the cost of the property on which allotment
was to be effected, crystallized when the Land Acquisition
Collector recommended the case of the petitioner on 31st
March, 2005.
effected

This court had directed that the allotment be

within

a

period

of

12

weeks

from

such

recommendation which expired on 30th June, 2005.

Even

assuming that this court had extended the time by the order
dated 30th March, 2006, then the DDA was bound to give the
petitioner the option within four weeks of the order and effected
allotment of the shop within a period of 12 weeks.

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.22

Such

process, if effectuated as directed by this court, would have
come to an end long before the recommendations of the Price
Fixation Committee on 24th August, 2006 and its approval by
the Vice-Chairman on 21st September, 2006.
47. In this background, in my view certainly the petitioner
cannot be prejudiced for the fault of the DDA and the delay
which has been caused by it in compliance of specific directions
of this court.
48. It is noteworthy that a totally arrogant and obdurate stand
is taken in court proceedings despite the failure to abide by the
specific directions of the court. There is no regard for either the
orders passed by the court or for rights of the petitioner. The
same is manifested in the notings placed before the court. In
the instant case, the petitioner has been deprived of his
business by the act of acquisition of his property. Possession
was taken as back as in the year 2000. Even these facts have
not moved the officials of the DDA to comply with the spirit of
the time bound directions issued by the court on 1st November,
2004 or on 31st March, 2006.
WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.23

49. On the other hand, it has been vehemently argued on
behalf of the DDA that in case the DDA is required to recover
the costs of the flat at the lower rate, public interest would
suffer. Reliance on all the afore-noticed judgments have been
placed to urge that the costs fixed by the DDA are binding. In
this behalf, it is astonishing that the DDA has made this
submission without considering the fact that the delay which
has occurred is a direct result of its failure to abide by the time
bound orders of the court.
50. So far as the reliance on the communication dated 15th
June, 2005, even this deserves to be examined from another
angle.
No reminder was issued after the letter dated 15th June,
2005 as if the responsibility of the DDA to comply with the
orders passed by the court on 1st of November, 2004 stood
absolved after sending this letter.

It was well within the

knowledge of the DDA that it had contested the writ petition. A
recommendation had been received from the Land Acquisition
Collector.

WP (C) No.18520/2006

Page No.24

51. If the DDA intended to comply with the directions of this
court in its letter and spirit, efforts were required and ought
have been made to obtain the orders of the court from its own
counsel who appeared in the matter in the court and any other
documents either from this court or from the office of the Land
Acquisition Collector. Instead no such effort was made. Court
orders are available even through the electronic mode. Without
making any effort in the matter, fault is attributed to the panel
counsel for delay in communication of the order in June, 2006.
Such submission fails to consider that DDA was admittedly
aware of the earlier order of 1st of November, 2004 which had
not been complied with.
On the contrary after sitting upon the matter for over two
years, it is now being contended that the petitioner is required
to be burdened with the increased costs for the same flat which
the petitioner had a fair chance of drawing earlier.

This is

clearly impermissible and unfair. The petitioner cannot legally
be required to pay such increase which has resulted by the
delay for which the DDA is clearly responsible.

52. It is noteworthy that the shop alloted to the petitioner is
admittedly part of the undisposed inventory of shops lying
unallotted.

Such delay prevented the DDA in recovering the

costs of a vacant shop for over two years since the passing of
first order passed on 11th January, 2004. Thus, if the interest of
the DDA has been prejudiced or jeopardized, the same is as a
direct consequence of its own failure to take action as per the
mandate of the orders of the court and to follow the prescribed
procedure. The DDA would, therefore, be justified in recovering
the differential from those who failed to take action as per the
court orders.
53. For all these reasons, it has to be held that the demand
made by the DDA in its letter dated 16-17th November, 2006 to
the extent that it raises demand of Rs.5,16,195/- upon the
petitioner towards allotment of the shop no.82, Pocket L(U),
LSC, Pitam Pura, New Delhi, is illegal and is hereby quashed.
The allotment, however, of the shop No.82, Pocket L,
Sector U, Third Floor, LSC, Pitam Pura, Pocket L(U), New Delhi
shall stand in the name of the petitioner.

54. The DDA is directed to issue within three weeks, a fresh
demand upon the petitioner on the rate of the said shop as
communicated by the DDA to the petitioner on 17th August,
2006.
55. The petitioner having already deposited such amount with
the DDA pursuant to the orders of the court, would be entitled
to possession of this shop forthwith.
56. The petitioner shall be entitled to costs of the present
proceeding which are quantified at Rs.25,000/- and shall be
paid within three weeks.
The writ petition is allowed in the above terms.
Dasti.
