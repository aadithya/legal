MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 3 rd May, 2005
passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Delhi Bench „G‟ in ITA
No.5059, 5060 and 5061/Del/04 relevant for the financial years 1995-96
to 1997-98.
2.

The Assessee is a non-resident company incorporated in Japan.

It has a liaison office in Delhi which employs local staff as well as
expatriate employees deputed from the parent company in Japan. In so
far as the local staff is concerned, the Assessee deducts tax at source in
respect of payment of salaries paid to them and there is no dispute in
this regard.

In so far as expatriate employees are concerned, they

receive salary both in India as well as in Japan. In respect of the salary
paid in India, the Assessee deducts tax at source. There was some
dispute with regard to deduction of tax on the salaries paid and benefits
given to the expatriate employees in Japan and also the method of
calculation. This has also been resolved and we are not directly
concerned with this, except to the extent of the fall-out of the resolution.
3.

On 24th January, 1998, a survey under Section 133A of the

Income Tax Act, 1961 (the Act) was carried out in the office premises of
the Assessee in Delhi.

As a result thereof, it was found that the

Assessee was not deducting tax at source in respect of certain payments
ITA No.1129/2005

Page 2 of 12

made to the expatriate employees. The Assessee gave its explanation,
but in any event, it suo motu agreed to pay taxes and interest thereon
without any demand being raised by the Revenue.
4.

In December, 1998 the Assessee paid to the Revenue an amount

of Rs.52,79,76,749/- towards payment of tax and interest thereon for a
period of ten years, that is, for the financial years 1988-89 to 1997-98.
The dispute in the present appeal pertains only to the financial years
1995-96 to 1997-98. The Assessee gave its calculations for the yearwise appropriations.
5.

Even after the payment was made, the Assessee was asked, from

time to time, to file necessary details not only with regard to the
payments made to the expatriate employees but also with regard to the
computation. At one point of time, proceedings under Section 271-C of
the Act were sought to be initiated against the Assessee for the purposes
of levying penalty on account of short deduction of tax but these
proceedings were dropped.
6.

Be that as it may, by an order dated 30th March, 2000, the

Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (DCIT) worked out the liability of
the Assessee for the ten financial years under Sections 201 and 201(1A)
of the Act. The tax liability worked out by him was Rs.41,03,49,352/and the interest liability was worked out at Rs.33,39,27,546/- making a
ITA No.1129/2005

Page 3 of 12

total of about Rs.75 crores. After adjusting the tax and interest already
paid by the Assessee of Rs.52,79,76,749/-, the tax liability for the ten
financial years was worked out at Rs.8,02,78,168/- and the interest
liability was worked out at Rs.15,00,91,350/- making a total of roughly
Rs.23 crores.
7.

Feeling aggrieved by the order passed by the DCIT, the

Assessee preferred an appeal before the Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) [CIT (A)] who dismissed the appeal of the Assessee and
upheld the liability.
8.

The Assessee then preferred a second appeal before the Income

Tax Appellate Tribunal (the Tribunal) which passed an order on 29th
November, 2002. The Tribunal arrived at two important conclusions,
namely, that the demand pertaining to the financial years 1988-89 to
1994-95 was barred by time having been made beyond a reasonable
period of four years. This conclusion has since become final. The
second important conclusion arrived at by the Tribunal was that the
method of grossing up adopted by the Revenue was erroneous and,
therefore, the tax and interest liability was required to be recomputed
correctly and in accordance with law. Accordingly, the orders passed
under Sections 201 and 201(1A) of the Act pertaining to the financial
years 1988-89 to 1994-95 were held to be illegal and were quashed and
ITA No.1129/2005

Page 4 of 12

for the financial years 1995-96 to 1997-98, the matter was remitted back
to the file of the Assessing Officer for making a re-computation in
accordance with law.
9.

After the matter was remitted back to the file of the DCIT for re-

computing the tax and interest liability, he held that the Assessee was
liable to pay tax of Rs.11,30,99,420/- and interest of Rs.13,98,93,597/for the three financial years. As regards the financial years 1988-89 to
1994-95, the Assessing Officer held that the Assessee was not entitled
to any refund whether of principal or of interest for these years and,
therefore, rejected the claim of the Assessee for refund. We are not
concerned with the refund issue.
10.

The Assessee then preferred an appeal before the CIT (A) which

was dismissed by him by an order dated 27th August, 2004.
11.

Feeling aggrieved, the Assessee then preferred an appeal before

the Tribunal which was allowed by the order which is now under
challenge under Section 260-A of the Act.
12.

After noting the facts of the case, the Tribunal framed two

questions for its consideration. These two questions read as follows:“i) Whether the appellant is entitled to a refund of taxes and
interest paid as a person responsible for deduction of [tax] on
salary paid to his employees. This issue arises for consideration
in FY 88-89 to 94-95.

ITA No.1129/2005

Page 5 of 12

ii) Whether the demand for tax and interest at
Rs.25,29,93,017/- made for the FY 95-96 to 97-98 without
giving credit to taxes and interest already paid for a sum of Rs.
14.88 crores, which is part of the sum of Rs.52.79 crores paid by
the appellant and which was appropriated towards tax and
interest due for FY 95-96 to 97-98 is proper. The second issue
arises for consideration in FY 95-96 to 97-98 only.”
13.

In so far as the first question is concerned, the Tribunal declined

to answer it since an identical question is already pending for
determination in this Court.
14.

In so far as the second question is concerned, the Tribunal

decided the issue in favour of the Assessee and we agree with the views
expressed by the Tribunal and are of the opinion that no substantial
question of law arises for consideration in this regard.
15.

What we are required to really consider is whether the Assessee

is entitled to be given credit for the taxes and interest already paid, that
is, Rs.14,88,61,518/- for the financial years 1995-96 to 1997-98. This
amount is a part of the amount of Rs.52.79 crores paid by the Assessee
in December, 1998. The additional demand made by the Revenue, as
determined on re-computation by the Assessing Officer, was
Rs.25,29,93,017/- and if the Assessee is given credit of the amount of
Rs.14.88 crores already paid by it in December, 1998, its tax and interest
liability would be reduced to that extent. This adjustment or credit has

ITA No.1129/2005

Page 6 of 12

been denied to the Assessee by the Assessing Officer and the CIT (A).
16.

Before we deal with the merits of the case, we may mention a

preliminary objection raised by learned counsel for the Revenue, which
was also raised before the Tribunal.

The objection is to the

maintainability of the appeal before the Tribunal on the ground that the
grounds of appeal have been signed by Mr. Hiroshi Yashino, General
Manager of the New Delhi office of the Assessee. He had filed the
appeal on the basis of a Power of Attorney dated 5 th March, 2003
executed by the Assessee, represented for the purpose of the Power of
Attorney by Mr. Hidetoshi Kamezaki, a representative Director and
Executive Vice President of the Assessee. The Power of Attorney was
duly notarised in Japan as per the Japanese law by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs. The Indian Consular in Tokyo had authenticated the
signatures of the competent authority in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
in Japan.
17.

The notarial certificate authenticating the Power of Attorney

certifies that Mr. Kayoko Gingawa stated in his presence that Mr.
Hidetoshi Kamezaki had signed the Power of Attorney. The objection
raised is that Mr. Hidetoshi Kamezaki did not himself appear before the
notary and, therefore, the Power of Attorney was not valid and
consequently the authorization given to Mr. Hiroshi Yashino was also
ITA No.1129/2005

Page 7 of 12

not valid making the appeal filed by him incompetent.
18.

We are not at all impressed by this preliminary objection for the

reason that the Power of Attorney appears to have been executed in
accordance with the laws of Japan and there is nothing to show that
under the Japanese law Mr. Kayoko Gingawa could not have made the
statement that he did or that it was absolutely necessary for Mr.
Hidetoshi Kamezaki to be personally present before the notary. No such
objection was raised by anybody before the Indian Consular in our
Embassy in Tokyo, Japan and it is now too late for the Revenue to raise
such an objection.
19.

Apart from the above, we are of the opinion that whether the

appeal was filed by a competent person or not, is a finding of fact
arrived at by the Tribunal and we do not see any reason to disturb this
finding unless it is perverse, in any manner, which it does not appear to
be. We are, therefore, of the opinion that no substantial question of law
has been made out in this regard by the Revenue.
20.

In this context, we may refer to Madras Port Trust v.

Hymanshu International, (1979) 4 SCC 176. In that case, the Supreme
Court made a very telling observation (though in the context of the
rights of citizens), which we think is worth quoting in extenso:

ITA No.1129/2005

Page 8 of 12

“The plea of limitation based on this section is one which the
court always looks upon with disfavour and it is unfortunate
that a public authority like the Port Trust should, in all
morality and justice, take up such a plea to defeat a just claim
of the citizen. It is high time that governments and public
authorities adopt the practice of not relying upon
technical pleas for the purpose of defeating legitimate
claims of citizens and do what is fair and just to the
citizens. Of course, if a government or a public authority
takes up a technical plea, the Court has to decide it and if the
plea is well-founded, it has to be upheld by the court, but
what we feel is that such a plea should not ordinarily be
taken up by a government or a public authority, unless of
course the claim is not well-founded and by reason of delay
in filing it, the evidence for the purpose of resisting such a
claim has become unavailable. Here, it is obvious that the
claim of the respondent was a just claim supported as it was
by the recommendation of the Assistant Collector of Customs
and hence in the exercise of our discretion under Article 136
of the Constitution, we do not see any reason why we should
proceed to hear this appeal and adjudicate upon the plea of
the appellant based on Section 110 of the Madras Port Trust
Act (II of 1905).
We accordingly revoke the special leave granted to the
appellant, and direct that the appellant do pay the cost of the
respondents.” (Emphasis given)
21.

We are mentioning this decision only to bring home the fact that

the State should not raise technical pleas for the sake of it and to defeat
a just claim. In the present case, we feel that the Revenue has raised a
plea of maintainability only to obfuscate the real issue and to deny to the
Assessee what is legitimately due to it. This is unfortunate, but we leave
it at that.
22.

On the merits of the case, the Tribunal has noted that after the

Assessing Officer re-computed the tax and interest at Rs.25,29,93,017/-

ITA No.1129/2005

Page 9 of 12

for the financial years 1995-96 to 1997-98, the Assessee was entitled to
be given credit for the amount that it had already paid towards tax and
interest for these very financial years, the payment having been made in
December, 1998.

There is absolutely no reason why the Assessee

cannot be given credit for the total payment made by it of
Rs.14,88,61,518/-. There is no dispute that the Assessee had paid this
amount towards tax and interest thereon. All that was required was for
the Assessing Officer to make a simple adjustment of the amount paid
against the amount due and re-calculate the tax liability of the Assessee.
The Tribunal has noted that the CIT (A) rejected the plea of the
Assessee for adjustment of the amount on three grounds. These have
been summarized as follows:“i)
The appropriation made by the appellant in its letter dt
21.12.98 did not have any legal sanctity when it was found that
the tax and interest paid were less than what was actually due to
proceedings determining tax and interest u/s 201(1) and
201(1A) were initiated by the AO.
ii)
The payment of Rs.52.79 crores by the appellant in Dec
98 was an “on account payment” for a period of time and the
appropriation of such payment in its order dt 30.3.200 shall be
taken as satisfaction or applicant‟s liability in the chronological
order of FY‟s involved viz 88-89 to 94-95.
iii) The appropriation by the appellant, even assuming there
was one, did no longer survive in view of the quashing of the
order u/s 201(1) and 201(1A) dt 30.3.2000 for FY 88-89 to 9495.”

ITA No.1129/2005

Page 10 of 12

23.

We are of the opinion that the view expressed by the CIT (A)

hardly provides any basis for denying credit for tax and interest paid by
the Assessee. The CIT (A) failed to appreciate that the appropriation
made by the Assessee in December, 1998 was not disputed at any stage
and it was now too late to dispute the manner of appropriation.
Moreover, the CIT (A) needlessly mixed up the tax chargeable for the
period 1988-89 to 1994-95, the demand for which was held to be barred
by time by the Tribunal. The State cannot recover or hold back any tax
except in accordance with law for otherwise it would be unjustly
enriching itself, which is clearly impermissible. The Revenue having
received and accepted the amount paid by the Assessee for the relevant
financial years that we are concerned with, it was under an obligation to
give credit to the Assessee for the payments already made or
appropriated against those very financial years. Otherwise the liability
of the Assessee would be unreasonably increased and the Assessee
would be required to pay tax and interest twice over (or at least a part
thereof) which is clearly unconscionable.
24.

In our opinion, the Tribunal did not at all err in directing the

Revenue to grant to the Assessee adjustment or credit of the amount of
Rs.14,88,61,518/- already paid by it in December, 1998 towards tax and
interest thereon for the financial years 1995-96 to 1997-98.

25.

No substantial question of law arises for consideration. In view

of the decision of the Supreme Court in Madras Port Trust the appeal is
dismissed with costs. Counsel‟s fee is assessed at Rs.10,000/-. The
Revenue will deposit this amount in the registry of this Court by a
crossed cheque drawn in favour of the Registrar General within four
weeks from today.
26.

List for compliance on 3rd May, 2008.
