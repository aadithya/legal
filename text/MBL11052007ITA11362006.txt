MADAN B. LOKUR, J.
The Revenue is aggrieved by an order dated 22nd July, 2005
passed by the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Lucknow Bench A,
Lucknow (for short the Tribunal) in ITA No.476/LUC/2001, C.O.
No.133/LUC/2004 and ITA No.709/LUC/2002.

ITA No.1136/2006

The decision in a

Page 2 of 16

fourth appeal decided by the Tribunal, being ITA No. 304/LUC/2001, is
not under challenge. All these appeals pertain to the assessment year
1996-97.

2.

Learned counsel for the assessee raised a preliminary

objection to the effect that this Court does not have territorial
jurisdiction to entertain these appeals under Section 260A of the Income
Tax Act, 1961 (the Act). It was submitted that the assessment order was
passed by the Assessing Officer on 23rd April, 1999 in Lucknow, an
appeal against that was decided by the Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) in Lucknow on 27th April, 2000 and a further appeal was
decided by the Tribunal in Lucknow on 26th May, 2003. It appears that
an appeal under Section 260A of the Act is pending before the Lucknow
Bench of the Allahabad High Court in respect of the order passed by the
Tribunal.

3.

In the second round of litigation (after remand of the case to

the Assessing Officer), the three authorities under the Act, namely, the
Assessing Officer, the Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals ) as well

ITA No.1136/2006

Page 3 of 16

as the Tribunal passed orders in Lucknow and it is against the second
order passed by the Tribunal on 22nd July, 2005 that the present appeals
under Section 260A of the Act have been filed in this Court.

4.

According to learned counsel for the assessee, since all the

proceedings and decisions had taken place in Lucknow, this Court does
not have territorial jurisdiction to entertain these appeals which, he says,
may be returned to the Appellant for presentation in the proper Court.

5.

We are not in agreement with the submissions of learned

counsel for the assessee and are of the view that we have the necessary
territorial jurisdiction to entertain this and the other two connected
appeals.

6.

On 29th July, 2005, an order was passed by the

Commissioner of Income Tax (Central), Kanpur under Section 127(2) of
the Act. This section provides as follows:
“127.

Power to transfer cases.

(2)
Where the Assessing Officer or Assessing
Officers from whom the case is to be transferred and the
Assessing Officer or Assessing Officers to whom the case
is to be transferred are not subordinate to the same Director
General or Chief Commissioner or Commissioner, (a) where the Directors General or Chief
Commissioners or Commissioners to whom such
Assessing Officers are subordinate are in agreement,
then the Director General or Chief Commissioner or
Commissioner from whose jurisdiction the case is to
be transferred may, after giving the assessee a
reasonable opportunity of being heard in the matter,
wherever it is possible to do so, and after recording
his reasons for doing so, pass the order;
(b) where the Directors General or Chief
Commissioners or Commissioners aforesaid are not
in agreement, the order transferring the case may,
similarly, be passed by the Board or any such
Director General or Chief Commissioner or
Commissioner as the Board may, by notification in
the Official Gazette, authorize in this behalf.

(4)
The transfer of a case under sub-section (1) or
sub-section (2) may be made at any stage of the
proceedings, and shall not render necessary the re-issue of
any notice already issued by the Assessing Officer or
Assessing Officers from whom the case is transferred.
Explanation – In Section 120 and this section, the word
“case”, in relation to any person whose name is specified in
any order or direction issued thereunder, means all
proceedings under this Act in respect of any year which
may be pending on the date of such order or direction or
which may have been completed on or before such date,
ITA No.1136/2006

Page 5 of 16

and includes also all proceedings under this Act which may
be commenced after the date of such order or direction in
respect of any year.”

7.

A bare perusal of the aforesaid provision makes it broadly

clear that the Director General or the Chief Commissioner or the
Commissioner, as the case may be, is empowered to transfer a case from
one jurisdiction to another on complying with the principles of natural
justice.

8.

In exercise of power conferred by Section 127(2) of the Act,

a notice was issued to the assessee on 20th June, 2005 giving an
opportunity of being heard in connection with the proposed transfer of
the case from the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax, Central
Circle-I, Lucknow to the Additional Commissioner of Income Tax,
Central Circle-VI, New Delhi. The notice was issued to the assessee
and also to others of the Sahara Group. The relevant portion of the
notice dated 20th June, 2005 reads as follows:
“The Sahara Group consists of several companies, firms
and individuals which are presently assessed to tax at
various places, including at Lucknow, Delhi and Kolkata.
The Group has over a period of time diversified its business
activities and across cities and towns of the country. There
ITA No.1136/2006

Page 6 of 16

is, however, an inter-lacing and inter-connection of funds
and of business activities amongst the various entities of
the Group.
2.
The Sahara Group had earlier filed an
application before the Chief Commissioner of Income Tax
(Central) North, New Delhi for the transfer of cases being
assessed in the Central Circle, Lucknow on the ground that
the administrative / control offices of most of cases of the
Group has shifted of Delhi. It is a fact that presently most
of the offices of the group concerns, including that of M/s.
Sahara Airlines Ltd. and of Sahara India (Firm) are located
in Delhi and many of the companies are also assessed to tax
at New Delhi.
3.
In view of the above, I am of the opinion that of
coordinated investigation and assessment, the cases of the
Sahara Group should be centralized in New Delhi.
4.
It is, therefore, proposed to transfer your case to
New Delhi and centralize the same with Asstt.
Commissioner of Income Tax, Central Circle-6, New Delhi
under the Addl. Commissioner of Income Tax, Central
Range-1 of Commissioner of Income Tax (Central)-1, New
Delhi Charge. You are hereby afforded an opportunity of
being heard in the matter in terms of provisions of section
127 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and for this purpose
authorized representative on 6th July at 11.00 A.M.”

9.

The assessee objected to the proposed transfer but the

objections were turned down by the Commissioner of Income Tax
(Central), Kanpur. Without going into the reasons for rejecting the
objections, the operative portion of the order dated 29th July, 2005 is

ITA No.1136/2006

Page 7 of 16

reproduced below:
“10.
In view of the above, the objections raised by
the assessee against the proposed transfer of its case to New
Delhi are not found tenable and are accordingly rejected.
11.
Accordingly, by virtue of power conferred by
sub-section (2) of Section 127 of the I.T. Act and all other
powers enabling me in the behalf, I, the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Central), Kanpur hereby transfer of the case,

10.

The order dated 29th July, 2005 was challenged by the

assessee before the Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court but by
a judgment and order dated 8th February, 2006, the Bench did not find
any arbitrariness or illegality in the order of transfer and, accordingly,
dismissed the writ petition filed by the assessee. The decision of the
ITA No.1136/2006

Page 8 of 16

Allahabad High Court is reported as Sahara Airlines Ltd. & Ors. v.
Director General of Income Tax (Investigation) & Ors., 2006 (202)
CTR 1. We are told that the decision of the Bench was taken up to the
Supreme Court but the petition for special to appeal was dismissed.
Consequently, it is quite clear that the order of transfer under Section
127(2) of the Act has now attained finality and cannot be reopened,
even collaterally.

11.

Learned counsel for the assessee contended that since the

assessment orders had already been passed in respect of the assessee and
a decision had also been taken by the Tribunal, there was no question of
transferring the jurisdiction in respect of the assessee from one place to
another. We are of the view that this argument is completely misplaced.
The Explanation to Section 127(4) of the Act tells us what the word
“case” means in relation to any person whose name is specified in any
order or direction issued under Section 127 of the Act. The Explanation
says that “case” means all proceedings under the Act in respect of any
year:
(i)

which may be pending on the date of the order or direction;

ITA No.1136/2006

Page 9 of 16

(ii)

which may have been completed on or before the date of the order

or direction;
(iii)

including all proceedings which may be commenced after the date

of the order or direction in respect of any year.

12.

In other words, the Explanation to Section 127(4) of the Act

talks of proceedings, past, present and future in respect of a person
whose name is specified in the order or direction passed under Section
127 of the Act and this would apply to any previous year.

13.

The order passed under Section 127(2) of the Act clearly

relates to the “case” of the assessee mentioned in the Schedule, and by
virtue of the Explanation, all future proceedings that may be taken under
the Act (obviously including an appeal under Section 260A thereof)
would now have to be in harmony with the order passed under Section
127(2) of the Act.

Consequently, the jurisdiction in respect of the

“case” and the assessee having been shifted from Lucknow to Delhi, the
Revenue could file the appeal under Section 260A of the Act only in
Delhi and it could not have filed an appeal in the Lucknow Bench of the

ITA No.1136/2006

Page 10 of 16

Allahabad High Court.

14.

Learned counsel for the assessee relied upon two decisions of

this Court to contend that the situs of the Assessing Officer is what
determines the jurisdiction of the High Court in respect of entertaining
an appeal under Section 260A of the Act. In support of his argument,
learned counsel relied upon Suresh Desai & Associates v.
Commissioner of Income-tax, (1998) 230 ITR 912 and Commissioner
of Income-tax v. Digvijay Chemicals Ltd., (2006) 204 CTR 234.

15.

We have gone through both these decisions with the

assistance of learned counsel for the parties and while the accepted
general principle is that the situs of the Assessing Officer is what
determines the High Court having jurisdiction over the case, none of
these decisions deal with one important aspect of the case (because it
did not arise), namely, what would happen when the situs of the
Assessing Officer is changed by an order passed under Section 127 of
the Act, as has happened in the present case. One important fact in both
the above decisions was that even though there was a transfer of

ITA No.1136/2006

Page 11 of 16

jurisdiction from one place to another, the proceedings in respect of the
relevant previous year had not been transferred from one jurisdiction to
another.

16.

In Suresh Desai, the relevant assessment year was 1980-81

and as mentioned in the decision, the assessment records of the
petitioner were ordered to be transferred from Bombay to Delhi but the
transfer did not pertain to the assessment year 1980-81. Similarly, in
Digvijay Chemicals, the relevant assessment year was 1993-94 but the
assessment records that were transferred to Delhi were those pertaining
to the assessment years 1988-89, 2000-01 and 2001-02. It is for this
reason that the effect of the transfer of jurisdiction under Section 127 of
the Act was not discussed either in Suresh Desai or in Digvijay
Chemicals because that question, on the facts of the case, did not arise
for consideration. Learned counsel for the assessee, therefore, cannot
draw any assistance from any of the two decisions cited by him.

17.

On the other hand, the effect of the transfer of jurisdiction

from Lucknow to Delhi specifically arises in the present case and we are

ITA No.1136/2006

Page 12 of 16

of the view that the jurisdiction in respect of the assessee having been
transferred to Delhi lock, stock and barrel and all the records of the
assessee also having been transferred from Lucknow to Delhi, it is only
the High Court in Delhi that can entertain an appeal under Section 260A
of the Act directed against the order passed by the Tribunal on 22nd
July, 2005.

Our conclusion follows from a plain reading of the

Explanation to Section 127(4) of the Act as well as from the effect of
the order dated 29th July, 2005 passed by the Commissioner of Income
Tax (Central), Kanpur under Section 127(2) of the Act. Consequently,
with effect from 29th September, 2005 (the date from which the order
passed under Section 127(2) of the Act is enforced) the jurisdiction in
respect of the assessee for future proceedings under Section 260A of the
Act is with the Delhi High Court. Admittedly, the present appeals have
been filed after 29th September, 2005 and so they would be
maintainable in this Court and no other High Court.

18.

Under the circumstances, we reject the contention of learned

counsel for the assessee.

ITA No.1136/2006

Page 13 of 16

19.

In so far as the merits of the case are concerned, the Revenue

has raised several issues and we are of the view that except one issue
which is based on facts, the other issues raise substantial questions of
law.

20.

The issue that does not raise any substantial question of law

pertains to the disallowance made by the Assessing Officer under
Section 43B of the Act of Rs.7,38,563/-. The Tribunal has noted in
paragraph 67 of its order that the Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) had verified the date of the challans and other documents
before deleting the addition made by the Assessing Officer. Since this
conclusion is based on a finding of fact, no substantial question of law
arises.

21.

In respect of the other issues, we admit this appeal and frame

the following questions of law:
1. Whether, on a correct interpretation of Section 68 of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal
was right in upholding the order of the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) deleting the addition of
Rs.8,55,25,37,618/- made by the Assessing Officer?

ITA No.1136/2006

Page 14 of 16

2. If the answer to Question No.1 is in the negative, whether
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was correct in law in
deleting the disallowance of Rs.50,12,45,795/- made by the
Assessing Officer on account of interest on deposits?
3. Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case,
the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in law in
deleting the addition of Rs.53,86,65,000/- made under
Section 68 of the Income Tax Act, 1961 on account of
unexplained cash credits in the nature of share capital, share
premium and share application money?
4. Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was correct in
law in deleting the addition of Rs.28,59,490/- made on
account of expenses pertaining to earlier years by accepting
the claim of the Assessee of reversal of excess transfer fee
credited in earlier years?
5. Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in
deleting the disallowance of Rs.5,01,750/- out of telecasting
fee being commission paid?
6. Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in
holding that the Assessing Officer did not “follow the
guidelines” given by the Commissioner of Income Tax
(Appeals) in his order dated 13th March, 2001?
7. Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in
declining the prayer of the Revenue to remand the matter to
the file of the Assessing Officer?
8. Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was right in
law in upholding the direction of the Commissioner of
Income Tax (Appeals) directing the Assessing Officer to
treat the assessment order as under Section 143(3) of the
Income Tax Act, 1961 instead of one under Section 144 of
the Act?

ITA No.1136/2006

Page 15 of 16

9. Whether the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal was justified
in law in disposing of the appeal of the Revenue (ITA
No.476/Luc/2001) as infructuous in view of the order dated
26th May, 2003 passed by the Tribunal in ITA
No.747/Alld/2000?
10. Whether the order dated 22nd July, 2005 passed by the
Income Tax Appellate Tribunal is perverse in law?

22.

Since

the

three

appeals

before

us,

namely,

ITA

No.1136/2006, ITA No.1155/2006 and ITA No.1147/2006 arise out of
the same order, and, as mentioned by the Tribunal, they involve
common grounds and were heard together and were disposed of together
by a composite order, the questions framed above also relate to all three
appeals, mutatis mutandis.

23.

Paper books be filed in accordance with the High Court

Rules. Only one set of paper books may be filed for all the three
appeals.
