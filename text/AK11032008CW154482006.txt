This is an application by the respondent/workman under Section

17 B of Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 seeking direction to the petitioner
to pay last drawn wages @ Rs. 4346/-from 23rd March, 2006 the date of
the order whereby the petitioner was directed to reinstate the
workman/respondent in service with continuity of service and to pay to
her arrears of salary with all consequential benefits from 17.01.2001,

the date of her discharge till her reinstatement.

2.

The case of the respondent/applicant is that the applicant was

working under the petitioner and his last drawn wages was Rs. 4346/-.
He was terminated from his services by the petitioner on 17th October,
2001. The workman raised an industrial dispute which was decided by
the Industrial Tribunal in his favor, by an award dated 25th March,
2006 directing reinstatement of the respondent in service with full back
wages.

3.

The applicant has categorically stated that since the date of his

termination, he has not been employed in any establishment with any
employer. He made his best efforts to get an alternative employment but
unfortunately could not succeed. The applicant submitted that he is
unemployed after the termination and he is entitled to receive wages @
Rs. 4346/- from the date of the award. The respondent/workmen has
categorically

stated

in

his

affidavit,

accompanying

the

present

application, that since the date of his termination, he has not been
employed in any establishment for any period of time.

4.

Reply to the application of the respondent under section 17B of

Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 has not been filed on behalf of
petitioner/non-applicant. The learned counsel for the petitioner,
CM 17789 of 2007 in WP(C) 15448 of 2006

Page 2 of 8

however, orally submitted that the petitioner does not wish to file reply
to the application of the respondent under section 17B of the Industrial
Disputes. In the facts and circumstances the averments made in the
application are deemed to be admitted as the same have not been
refuted by the petitioner/non applicant.

5.

Perusal of Section 17 B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947

reveals that it comes into operation when an Award directing
reinstatement of a workman is assailed in further proceedings by the
employer. The preliminary consideration for making available such a
relief under Section 17B to a workman is to be found in the benevolent
purpose of the enactment, its spirit, intendment and object underlying,
which is to mitigate and relieve, to a certain extent, the hardship which
would be caused to a workman due to delay in the implementation of an
award directing reinstatement of his services on account of the
challenge made to it by the employer. Section 17B recognizes a
workman’s right to the bare minimum to keep the body and soul
together when a challenge has been made to an Award directing his
reinstatement. The statutory provisions provide no inherent right of
assailing an order or an award by an industrial adjudicator by way of
an appeal. The payment which is required to be made by the employer
to the workman has been held to be akin to a subsistence allowance
which is neither refundable nor recoverable from a workman even if the
CM 17789 of 2007 in WP(C) 15448 of 2006

Page 3 of 8

Award in his favor is set aside by the High Court. In 1999 (2) SCC 106
(para 22), Dena Bank v. Kiritikumar T. Patel the Apex Court was of the
view that the object under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is only to relieve to a certain extent, the hardship that is caused to
the workman due to the delay in implementation of the Award.

6.

Moreover granting relief under Section 17B of the Act and passing

orders directing payment of wages last drawn, is generally the rule;
refusing to grant relief under Section 17B is an exception, as the relief
could be denied only in the rarest of the rare cases of jurisdictional
error where there is no relationship of employer and employee between
the parties.

7.

Thus if the requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes

Act, 1947 are satisfied then no order can be passed denying the
workman the benefit of statutory provisions of Section 17B of the
Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. The statute requires satisfaction of the
following four conditions:
(i) an Award by a Labour Court, Tribunal or National
Tribunal directing reinstatement of a workman is assailed
in proceedings in a High Court or the Supreme Court;
(ii) during the pendency of such proceedings, employer is
required to pay full wages to the workman;
(iii) the wages stipulated under Section 17B are full wages
CM 17789 of 2007 in WP(C) 15448 of 2006

last drawn by him, inclusive of any maintenance allowance
admissible to him under any Rule;
(iv) such wages would be admissible only if the workman
had not been employed in any establishment during such
period and an affidavit had been filed to such effect

8.

The practice of disposal of the petition as well as the application

under Section 17B of the Act contemporaneously was deprecated by the
Apex Court and the High Court was directed to first expeditiously
dispose of the application under Section 17B by the Supreme Court by
its decision reported at VII (2000) SLT 70=JT 2000 (8) SC 501,
Workmen Hindustan Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. v. Hindustan
Vegetable Oil Corporation Ltd. & Ors. While considering an application
under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, the Court cannot go
into the merits of the case in the writ petition. It was so held in 86
(2000) DLT 510=2000 (5) AD (Delhi) 413, Anil Jain v. Jagdish Chander.

9.

Whether the applicant is entitled for last drawn wages or

something more. In 1970 1 SCR 51 entitled Town Municipal, Athani v.
P.O. LC Hugli & Ors. it was held by the Apex Court that a workman has
a legal right to wages under the Minimum Wages Act, 1948 and cannot
be diverted to a remedy under Section 20 of the Minimum Wages Act for
enforcing such right. In this case, the Apex Court was concerned with
the power of the Act under Section 33(C)(2) of the Industrial Disputes
CM 17789 of 2007 in WP(C) 15448 of 2006

Page 5 of 8

Act, 1947 and the principles laid down by the Court would have a
bearing on the issues raised before this Court as well. From the
authoritative pronouncements of the Apex Court, the right of a
workman to an amount equivalent to the wages notified under the
Minimum Wages Act, 1948 is thus, in fact, recognition of the
constitutional mandate. Full wages last drawn can therefore only mean
all the wages that have fallen due at least from the date of the Award.

10.

In the present case the workman has categorically averred in the

application that he has been unemployed since the date of the
termination of his services and therefore, he is also unemployed since
the date when award was passed directing his reinstatement which has
been not been implemented on account of pendency of the present
petition. In the facts and circumstances, the applicant fulfills the
criteria for availing the benefit under section 17B of the act and if the
requisites of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are
satisfied, no order can be passed denying the workman the benefit of
statutory provisions of Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947
to the respondent workman.

Consequently, the application of the

workman/respondent under Section 17B of the Industrial Disputes Act,
1947 is to be allowed. The petitioner has not averred that the
respondent workman is employed with an establishment nor has
produced anything to show that he is gainfully employed in an

CM 17789 of 2007 in WP(C) 15448 of 2006

establishment.

11.

For the foregoing reasons the application under Section 17B of

the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is allowed. The petitioner is directed
to pay the last drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher
from the date of order, 23rd March, 2006. Arrears of last drawn wages or
minimum wages whichever is higher be paid to the respondent
workman within eight weeks. The petitioner shall continue to pay last
drawn wages or minimum wages whichever is higher by the 15th of
every English Calendar month during the pendency of the writ petition.
The respondent workman is also directed to give an undertaking to the
effect that in case the petition is allowed, the difference in last drawn
wages and the minimum wages shall be repaid/refunded by the
respondent/workman to the petitioner within the time as shall be
permitted by this Court. The undertaking be filed by the respondent
within eight weeks. With these directions, the application is disposed of.
