1.

Vide CRP No.1150/2003 petitioners have challenged

the order dated 17.9.2003 dismissing an application dated
25.2.2002 filed by the petitioners under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.1 of 21

praying that Kushagr Ansal, grandson of deceased defendant
No.1 be brought on record as a defendant. I note that vide said
application prayer was also made to condone the delay in filing
the said application.
2.

The application of the petitioner has been dismissed

holding that the suit stood abated and no explanation was
forthcoming justifying delay to be condoned. It has been held
that

there

has

been

an

inordinate

impleadment of Kushagr Ansal as a legal

delay

in

seeking

representative of

deceased defendant No.1.
3.

Order challenged in CRP No.1154/2003 is an order of

even date dismissing application dated 19.2.2001 filed by the
petitioners to implead the 6th natural legal heir of deceased
defendant No.1. Reason thereof is that the said natural legal
heir had admitted that the deceased had executed a will in
respect of the suit property in favour of her grandson Kushagr
Ansal and hence could not be impleaded as defendants.
4.

As would be evident from the facts hereinafter, the

usual attempts by the defendants to put obstacles and hope
that somehow or the other, the plaintiff trips and hence loses
the race is what has happened in the instant case; albeit with
some assistance from the plaintiffs who remained casual in
their approach.
5.

Indeed, the bane of the legal system in India is the

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.2 of 21

complex web of procedural laws which are sometimes used
with lethal effect by a defendant to trip the plaintiff. Needless
to state, to succeed in a suit, the plaintiff has to cover the
entire journey from the start till the end. The defendant has
not to run in the said race. As long as the defendant is able to
prevent the plaintiff from reaching the destination point, the
defendant succeeds in his mission.
6.

If the plaintiff has to run 100 Km and he successfully

runs 99.999 Km but fails to take the last step over the finishing
line which is just about a meter away, the plaintiff loses the
race. The defendant is declared the winner – by default.
7.

It is on account of the aforesaid reasons that Courts

in India have interpreted procedural laws with a purpose and a
meaning which furthers, not hampers, the cause of substantive
justice.
8.

Reported decisions can be found in abundant

measure holding that rules of procedure are the handmaid of
justice. That the language of the draftsman of processual law
may be liberal or stringent, but the fact remains that the object
of prescribing procedure is to advance the cause of justice.
9.

There are numerous decisions which hold that in an

adversial system, no party should be denied an opportunity of
participating in the process of justice dispensation unless
compelled by an express or specific language of the statute.

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.3 of 21

10.

In the report published as 1975 (1) SCC 774 Sushil

Kumar Singh vs. State of Bihar, the Supreme Court cautioned
that too much or over emphasis to procedure should be
avoided because the humanist rule is that procedure should be
the handmaid, not the mistress of justice.

This compels the

vesting of a residuary power in Judges to act ex debito justiciae
where the tragic sequel otherwise would be wholly inequitable.
It was opined that justice is the goal of jurisprudence –
processual as much as substantive.
11.

Indeed, procedural laws are the servant and not the

master in a justice delivery system.

Procedure laws are

lubricants and not resistants in the administration of justice.
12.

As early as 1955, in the opinion reported as AIR

1955 SC 425 Sangram Singh vs. Election Tribunal, the Supreme
Court opined that:-

13.

“Now a code of procedure must be regarded as
such. It is procedure, something designed to
facilitate justice and further its ends: not a penal
enactment for punishment and penalties; not a
thing designed to trip people up. Too technical
construction of sections that leaves no room for
reasonable elasticity of interpretation should
therefore be guarded against (provided always
that justice is done to both sides) lest the very
means designed for the furtherance of justice be
used to frustrate it.”
In the report published as AIR 1998 SC 1827

Shreenath & Anr. vs. Rajesh & Ors., it was held that procedural
law should not ordinarily be construed as mandatory; that
procedural law is always subservient and is in aid to justice. An
CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.4 of 21

interpretation which alludes or frustrates the recipient of justice
is not to be followed.
14.

With the aforesaid backdrop of the understanding of

the procedural laws, I fish in the troubled water of the facts.
15.

Petitioners are the plaintiffs in a suit seeking a

decree, inter alia, for specific performance of an immovable
property bearing No.82, Jor Bagh, New Delhi. The defendants
in the suit are Mrs. Suraj Kumari, Mr.Sushil Ansal, Mr.Gopal
Ansal, Mr. Deepak Ansal (her 3 sons) and one Mr.Rajiv Chander
Agarwal.
16.

The suit was filed on the original side of this Court

and was last heard in this Court by a learned Judge on the
original side on 6.9.2000.
17.

Noting that there was a change in the pecuniary

jurisdiction of this Court i.e. it was enhanced and there was a
corresponding enhancement in the pecuniary jurisdiction of the
District Courts the suit was ordered to be transferred to the
District Judge to be assigned to a Court of competent
jurisdiction. Parties were directed to appear before the District
Judge on 2.11.2000.
18.

Defendant

No.1,

Mrs.Suraj

Kumari

died

on

15.10.2000 i.e. in between the date 6.9.2000 and 2.11.2000.
19.

On 2.11.2000 the learned District Judge assigned

the suit to a learned Additional District Judge who happened to

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.5 of 21

be on leave. The reader of the Court recorded an order dated
2.11.2000 adjourning the matter for 1.12.2000. On said date
i.e. 1.12.2000 matter was adjourned for 25.1.2001.
20.

According to the petitioners i.e. the plaintiffs they

had filed an application in November 2000 stating that
defendant No.1 had died and was survived by her 3 sons,
already impleaded as defendants No.2 to 4 in the suit and 3
daughters

namely

Ms.Meenakshi Verma.

Ms.Leela

Abbi,

Ms.Indra

Puri

and

Accordingly, the prayer made was to

implead the 3 daughters of deceased defendant No.1 as
defendants and additionally to note that the other 3 legal heirs
i.e. the sons were already on record as defendants No.2 to 4.
Said application was stated to be filed under Order 22 Rule 4
CPC.
21.

According to the petitioners said application which

was handed over to the reader of the court was not put in the
file by the reader. Thus when the learned Judge took up the
suit for consideration on 25.1.2001 and it was noted that the
application was not on record the aforesaid fact was brought to
the notice of the Judge who queried from the counsel for the
defendants whether it was true.

That counsel for the

defendants accepted that he had received the application
under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC seeking impleadment. According to
the plaintiffs the Judge simply renotified the matter for

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.6 of 21

26.2.2001, orally observing that the plaintiffs may place on
record a copy of the said application.
22.

In between 1.12.2000 and 25.1.2001 Kushagr Ansal

grandson of the deceased filed an application under Section
151 CPC stating that his grandmother had executed a will
dated 11.5.1999 and as per the will had bequeathed her share
in the suit property to him.
23.

The said application dated 9.1.2001 (at pages 608-

611) of the record of the Trial Judge makes no prayer. It is in
the nature of an information to the Court and the parties that
the applicant claims inheritance to the share of the deceased in
the suit property under the will.
24.

In the record of the learned Trial Judge I find a

photocopy of an application (at pages 612 – 617) purporting to
be dated November 2000 stating about the death of deceased
defendant No.1 and praying that her sons were already
impleaded as defendants No.2 to 4, thus her 3 daughters be
impleaded as defendants.
25.

On 19.2.2001 an application was filed by the

plaintiffs under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC read with Section 5 of the
Limitation Act stating therein that on 25.1.2001 when it was
noted that earlier application filed by the plaintiffs in November
2000 for impleadment of the legal heirs of deceased defendant
No.1 was not on record, the learned Judge orally directed that

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.7 of 21

the plaintiffs should file another application.

Accordingly, it

was stated that the application in question was filed praying
that delay in filing the application under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC
be condoned and legal representatives of deceased defendant
No.1 be brought on record.

In paras 4 to 6 of the said

application following has been averred:“4.
Pursuant to the orders of District
Judge, the matter was directed to be listed
before this Hon'ble Court on 2.11.2000. On the
said date the Hon'ble Presiding Officer of this
Court was on leave and the matter was
adjourned to 01.12.2000. In the meanwhile,
the plaintiffs learnt that the defendant No.1
namely Smt.Suraj Kumari died on 15.10.2000.
The plaintiffs accordingly made an application
under Order 22 Rule 4 read with Section 151 of
the Code of Civil Procedure for bringing the
legal representatives of defendant No.1 on
record.
5.
Pursuant to the transfer of the
matter to this Hon'ble Court, the plaintiffs
engaged Sudhir K. Makkar, Adv. and entrusted
him with the matter. The counsel for the
plaintiffs prepared an application for bringing
the legal representatives on record and after
getting the same duly signed by the plaintiffs,
the counsel for the plaintiff sent the said
application
along
with
duly
signed
vakalatnama,
through
his
associate
Sh.B.K.Chauhan, Advocate, for being filed
before this Hon'ble Court.
Sh.B.K.Chauhan
filed the said application with this Hon'ble
Court about 2 to 3 days before the scheduled
date
of
hearing
being
01.12.2000.
Sh.B.K.Chauhan was informed that the
application shall be listed along with the main
matter on the next date of hearing which was
01.12.2000.
6.
On 01.12.2000, the counsel for the
plaintiffs was held up in some other work and
CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.8 of 21

26.

Sh.Ashwal Vaderaa, Adv. was to attend the
matter on behalf of the counsel for the
plaintiff.
Sh.Ashwal Vaderaa reached this
Hon'ble Court a little late and was informed
that the proceedings in the matter had been
adjourned to 25.01.2000.”
Cognizance of the aforesaid application has been

taken by the learned Judge by recording on the application
itself that it would be taken up for consideration on 20.2.2001.
On 20.2.2001 an order was passed directing notice to be
issued to the defendants. The notice was made returnable for
26.2.2001 the date already notified.
27.

It is the case of the plaintiffs that when the learned

Judge noted the pleadings in the application dated 19.2.2001
he was of the opinion that reference in the application to the
verbal directions stated to have been given by the Judge on
25.1.2001 and what transpired in the Court on said date should
be removed.

The plaintiffs were advised to file another

application under Order 22 Rule 4 of the Code of Civil
Procedure by deleting reference to what transpired in Court on
25.1.2001.

According to the plaintiffs they agreed to do so.

Accordingly, a third application under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC
dated 25.4.2001 came to be filed which was taken up for
consideration on the next date i.e. 26.4.2001.
28.

On 26.4.2001 following order has been recorded by

the learned Judge:“The counsel for the plaintiff has moved an
application for condonation of delay in
CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.9 of 21

29.

application U/O 22 Rule 4 CPC. Copy given to
counsel for the defendant and it is stated that
the counsel for the defendant has no objection
for the condonation of delay part of this
application.
To come up for reply to the
application for dated 06.07.2001. It is stated by
the counsel for the plaintiff that on the same
subject matter the earlier application was also
moved which not not being pressed, and is
dismissed as withdrawn.”
In this third application (pages 618 – 621 of the LCR)

it has been, inter alia, pleaded in para 5 and 6 as under:“5.
The matter was listed on 25.01.2001
when it was learnt that the application filed by
the plaintiffs for bringing on record the legal
representatives of defendant No.1 was not
traceable on record. The application has been
apparently misplaced and could not be traced
despite this Hon'ble Court having directed the
Court Master and Ahlmad to trace the said
application.

30.

6.
The applicants/plaintiffs have already
filed another copy of the application for bringing
the legal representatives on record on
28.01.2001 which is on record. The Applicants
submit that in fact there is no delay in filing of
the application. However, since the applicants
have placed a fresh copy of the application on
record on 28.01.2001, in view of the original
application having been misplaced, the technical
delay, if any, may be condoned in view of the
foregoing submissions. It is submitted that till
25.01.2001 the counsel for the plaintiffs was
under a bona fide impression that the application
filed by the plaintiffs for bringing on record the
legal representatives of defendant No.1 was
already on record.”
One fact has emerged. That the learned Judge was

not exercising proper care over his staff.

The staff was not

placing the applications on record. This is evident by the fact
that application filed on 19.2.2001, receipt whereof was noted

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.10 of 21

by the Judge in the order dated 20.2.2001 has been placed in
the file after second application was received by the learned
Judge on 26.4.2001.
31.

Thereafter,

various

dates

were

consumed

to

complete pleadings in the application under Order 22 Rule 4
CPC filed by the plaintiffs which was received by the learned
Judge in Court on 26.4.2001.
32.

Matter was renotified from time to time.

On

25.2.2002 plaintiffs filed another application under Order 22
Rule 4 CPC praying that in view of the fact that Kushagr Ansal
was staking a claim under a will stated to have been executed
by deceased defendant No.1 and that the 3 sons and the 3
daughters of the deceased had accepted the will evidenced by
the reply filed by them to the applications filed by the plaintiffs
under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC, Kushagr Ansal should be impleaded
as a legal heir of the deceased.
33.

As noted herein above, vide 2 orders of even date

i.e. 17.9.2003, application filed by the plaintiffs seeking
impleadment of the 6 children of the deceased as legal heirs as
also application filed on 25.2.2002 for impleadment of Kushagr
Ansal were dismissed.
34.

I note that the first order records as if only one

application i.e. the application which was received by the Judge
in Court on 20.2.2001 was required to be decided.

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.11 of 21

35.

The order records dismissal of said application.

36.

Vide the second order passed on the same date it

was held that since no prayer was made for setting aside of the
abatement and since application dated 25.2.2002 was filed
much beyond 60 days and even 90 days thereafter i.e. 150
days of the death of the deceased, the said application was
also dismissed.
37.

The result of the 2 orders is that legal heir of

deceased defendant No.1 not being brought on record, the
inevitable conclusion would be that the suit would stand abated
qua defendant No.1. Since the cause of action pleaded in the
suit is joint against defendants No.1 to 4, the suit would abate
as a whole.
38.

I think, I have reached the stage to deal with the

legal issues which have been advanced by learned counsel for
the parties.
39.

At the forefront is the challenge of the respondents

to the maintainability of the civil revision petition on 2 counts.
Firstly, it is urged that the impugned orders cannot be
questioned under the revisional powers of this Court.
40.

Reliance has been placed upon the decision of the

Supreme Court in AIR 2003 SC 2324, Shiv Shakti Cooperative
Housing Society vs. Swaraj Developers.
41.

I need not waste my time dealing with the said

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.12 of 21

preliminary objection, for the reason as noted above, effect of
the impugned order is that the suit would stand abated. Thus,
the impugned orders result in finality to the suit.

In Shiv

Shakti's case (supra), Supreme Court has held that only such
orders which result in the final disposal of the suit are
amenable to the revisional jurisdiction of this Court.

Thus, I

hold that the revision petitions are maintainable.
42.

A second attack to the jurisdiction of this Court has

been predicated on a very ingenuous argument.

It merits a

consideration. Shri A.S.Chandhiok, learned senior counsel for
the respondents urged that admittedly, application which has
been

decided

vide

order

dated

17.9.2003

dismissing

petitioner's application under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC was the one
which was filed in the Court on 25.2.2002 seeking impleadment
of Kushagr Ansal as a legal heir of the deceased.
43.

Learned senior counsel urged that notwithstanding

the label of the application i.e. an application under Order 22
Rule 4 CPC, since the application was filed much beyond even
150 days of the death of the deceased, the application had to
be treated as invoking a remedy under Order 22 Rule 9 CPC.
44.

Learned senior counsel urged that inasmuch as

abatement of the suit had not been set aside and the sine qua
non for impleading Kushagr Ansal as a legal heir of the
deceased was to firstly set aside the abatement, order had to

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.13 of 21

be treated as one passed under Order 22 Rule 9 CPC and in
view of the Order 43 Rule 1 (k), an appeal was maintainable
against the said order. Thus, on account of availability of an
effective alternative remedy, it was prayed that the civil
revision petition was not maintainable.
45.

The said preliminary objection requires to be

considered along with the merits of the controversy, for the
reason, as recorded above, 3 prior applications exist on record
invoking Order 22 Rule 4 CPC.

The first is a copy of an

application under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC bearing the date
November 2000, available in the record of the learned Trial
Judge at pages 612 to 615, original whereof is stated to have
been filed but misplaced. The second is the application once
again invoking Order 22 Rule 4 CPC received by the learned
Judge on 19.2.2001, original copy available at pages 623 to
627 of the record of the learned Trial Judge followed by the
third application once again invoking Order 22 Rule 4 CPC
taken on record by the learned Trial Judge on 26.4.2001 stating
that since application filed in November 2000 was not available
on record said application was being filed so that impleadment
of legal heirs of deceased defendant No.1 could be effected.
46.

I find from the record of the learned Trial Judge that

at pages 630-633 there exists a reply dated 9.1.2001 by the
daughters of the deceased defendant No.1 to an application

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.14 of 21

under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC filed by the plaintiffs.

The reply

bearing the date 9.1.2001 has been filed in Court on 9.8.2001.
47.

It is thus apparent that the reply has been filed to an

application under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC received by the
daughters of the deceased defendant No.1 prior to 9.1.2001.
This reply can only be to the application which plaintiffs claim
was filed in Court in November 2000, copy whereof was refiled
and is available at pages 612-615 of the record of the learned
Trial Judge.
48.

It is thus apparent that the 2nd application under

Order 22 Rule 4 CPC filed on 19.2.2001 followed by the third
application dated 26.4.2001 were filed inasmuch as the
application

filed

in

November

2000

was

misplaced

(subsequently photocopy placed on record). The second and
the third applications are surplus applications.
49.

The 4th application filed on 25.2.2002 under Order

22 Rule 4 CPC seeking impleadment of Kushagr Ansal can be
treated as an application in continuation of the application filed
in the month of November 2000. Such an interpretation would
further the cause of substantive justice and a contrary view
would impede the cause of substantive justice.
50.

Had the learned Trial Judge been vigilant and had it

been noted that the daughters of the deceased had prepared a
reply dated 9.1.2001 to an application filed by the plaintiffs

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.15 of 21

under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC it would have dawned upon him
that within 60 days of the death of the deceased an application
under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC had been filed.
51.

I may additionally note that in the subsequent

applications filed by the plaintiffs under Order 22 Rue 4 CPC,
averments of the plaintiffs in said applications noted in para 25
and 29 above pertaining to the filing of an application under
Order 22 Rule 4 CPC in the month of November 2000 have not
been denied by the respondents.
52.

Thus, there is no question of the suit having abated.

53.

Technically, the second preliminary objection urged

by learned counsel for the defendants may appear sound, but a
deeper meaningful probe, stripping the contention of the
technicalities of law, would reveal that the plaintiffs have
suffered due to a sloppy maintenance of the Court record by
the Court reader coupled with lack of supervision by the
learned Judge.
54.

In the facts and circumstances the maxim of equity,

viz., actus curiae neminem gravabit – an act of Court shall
prejudice no man, shall be applicable.
55.

The maxim is founded upon justice and good sense

and serves a safe and certain guide for the administration of
law.
56.

I accordingly hold that in sum and substance what

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.16 of 21

was required to be considered on account of death of deceased
defendant No.1, pertaining to the cause of action surviving was
the application filed by the plaintiffs in the month of November
2000 before the learned Trial Judge.
57.

The subsequent applications under Order 22 Rule 4

CPC were at best reminder to the learned Judge that the
plaintiffs had filed an application under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC in
the month of November 2000. That such an application was
handed over to the reader with copy supplied to counsel for the
defendants is evident from the reply dated 9.1.2001 filed by
the 3 daughters of the deceased in August 2001.

As noted

herein above, by 19.1.2001 only 1 application could have
reached the hands of said legal heirs, viz, the application which
plaintiffs claim to have handed over to the reader of the Court
in the month of November 2000.
58.

As regards the 4th application filed under Order 22

Rule 4 CPC wherein impleadment of Kushagr Ansal was prayed
for, a purposive meaning to the application which has to be
assigned is that the said application has to be treated as
supplementing the averments of the plaintiffs in the application
under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC filed in the month of November
2000.
59.

Matter could be looked at from another angle.

Kushagr Ansal filed an application on 25.1.2001 informing that

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.17 of 21

he was the sole surviving heir of the deceased.
60.

His application can be treated as a prayer by him to

be impleaded as a legal heir of the deceased.
61.

Can it not be argued that where a legal heir himself

comes forward and informs to the Court, by way of a written
application that he is the legal heir, cannot said application be
treated as an application under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC?
62.

Sub rule (1) of Order 22 Rule 4 CPC reads as under:-

63.

“4. Procedure in case of death of one of
several defendants or of sole defendant.(1) Where one of two or more defendants dies
and the right to sue does not survive against the
surviving defendant or defendants alone, or a
sole defendant or sole surviving defendant dies
and the right to sue survives, the Court, on an
application made in that behalf, shall cause the
legal representative of the deceased defendant
to be made a party and shall proceed with the
suit.”
The language of the aforesaid legislative provision

does not mandate that the application envisaged by the said
legislative provision has to be filed by the plaintiffs. For good
reasons, the legislature has used the expression 'on an
application made in that behalf'.

It has not been mandated

that the application has to be filed by the plaintiffs. Thus, a
legal

heir

may

come

forward

and

move

the

requisite

application.
64.

I have noted herein above the decisions of the

Supreme Court pertaining to the interpretation of procedural
laws.

I have noted herein above the principles applicable

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

Pg.No.18 of 21

where a Court is responsible for creating a situation.
65.

The summary of the events and the story as it has

unfolded, recorded in detail in the preceding paras herein
above, compels this Court to do substantive justice and not
electrocute the plaintiffs due to a defective Court mechanism
where the reader of the Court failed to preserve the purity of
the record, to quash the impugned orders dated 17.9.2003
which are challenged in the 2 captioned petitions. I hold that
there is no question of abatement arising, neither impugned
order can be treated as one under Order 29 Rule 9 CPC. The
impugned orders have to be treated under Order 22 Rule 4 CPC
and since the first application was filed in the month of
November 2000, well within 60 days of the death of the
deceased and further holding that the application filed on
25.2.2002 has to be read in furtherance of the application filed
in the month of November 2000, I allow the civil revision
petitions.
66.

Both impugned orders are quashed.

Application

filed by the plaintiffs for impleadment of Kushagr Ansal as the
legal heir of deceased defendant No.1 is allowed taking on
record that the sons and daughters of deceased have accepted
his claim under the will executed by their mother i.e.
grandmother of Kushagr Ansal.

Before concluding I may note that learned counsel

Pg.No.19 of 21

for the parties had addressed arguments with respect to
Section 211 of the Indian Succession Act as also Section 231 of
the Indian Succession Act; arguments being that under Section
211 of the Indian Succession Act, the executors appointed
under a will are the legal representatives of the deceased and
since the will relied upon by Kushagr Ansal appoints the 3 sons
of the deceased as executors, they were already on record as
defendants No. 2 to 4 and therefore the legal representatives
of the deceased being already on record no substitution was
required.

This was the argument advanced by Shri Shanti

Bhushan, learned senior counsel for the plaintiffs.

It was

sought to be countered by learned senior counsel for the
respondents who urged that under Section 234 of the Indian
Succession Act, where the executors decline to execute the will
they cannot be treated as the legal representatives and the
beneficiary under the will would have to be treated as the legal
representative.

Mr.A.S.Chandhiok, learned senior counsel for

the respondents had urged that inasmuch as the 3 sons had
not volunteered to execute the estate of the deceased, their
presence

cannot

be

treated

as

presence

by

the

legal

representatives of the deceased.
68.

I need not deal with the said contentions for the

reasons, in my opinion, in the facts and circumstances of the
instant case and the view which has been taken by me, said

CRP No.1150/03 & 1154/03

issue does not arise for consideration.
69.

No costs.
