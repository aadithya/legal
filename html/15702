<meta name="DC.description" content="Dismissing the appeal, this Court    HELD : 1.1. Applying the requirements set out in Paragraph 5 of the  &quot;Instructions&quot; in respect of Civil Service Examination, to the instant  case, it will be found that since the parents of the respondent were living  in District Howrah for more than 30 years before the Examination in  question was held, the District Officer or the Sub-Divisional Officer could  legally issue the Caste Certificate and also certify that his parents were  &quot;ordinarily residing&quot; in District Howrah. In such a situation, the respon-  dent had no option but to obtain the Certificate from the Sub-Divisional  Officer, Howrah, as he could not have deviated from the &quot;Instructions&quot;  already issued by the UPSC. [8-D-E; F]    1.2. In determining whether a person was ordinarily residing in a  particular constituency, the factOTHERSmentioned in sub-section 20-(1) (1A)  alone would not be determinative of the status. It would have to be  determined on a consideration of all other relevant factOTHERSThis is clear  from Section 20(7) of the Act. [11-B-C]    13. The parents of the respondent lived at one time in a village in  District Siwan in the State of Bihar and that owned some property there.  They had shifted to the State of West Bengal long ago and had been living  there since then. Therefore, for all intents and purposes, they shall be  treated to be &quot;ordinarily residing'' in the State of West Bengal. For the  State of West Bengal, the President, in exercise of his powers under  Article 341(1) read with Article 366(24) had already declared &quot;Nuniya&quot;  Caste a Scheduled Caste and, therefore, the respondent was rightly treated  to be a Scheduled Caste candidate and was rightly appointed against a  reserved Vacancy, after being declared successful at the examination held  by the UPSC for the Indian Administrative AND Allied Services in 1966. [15-E-  G]    2.1. The word &quot;reside&quot; has been defined as &quot;dwell permanently or for a  considerable time; to have one's settled or usual abode; to live in or at a  particular place.&quot; The meaning, therefore, covers not only the place where  the person has a permanent residence but also the place where the person  has resided for a &quot;considerable time&quot;. It also means to &quot;live, dwell,  abide, sojourn, stay, remain, lodge; to settle oneself or a thing in a  place, to be stationed, to remain or stay, to dwell permanently or  continuously, to have a settled abode for a time, to have one's residence  or domicile; specifically, to be residence to have an abiding place, to be  present as an element, to inhere as a quality, to be vested as a right.  [11-E-G]    22. The word &quot;residence&quot; has been defined as &quot;personal presence at some  place of abode with no present intention of definite and early removal and  with purpose to remain for undetermined period, not infrequently, but not  necessarily combined with design to stay permanently. [11-G-H]    23. It becomes clear that before a person, can be said to be &quot;ordinari-ly  residing&quot; at a particular place, he has to have an intention to stay at  that place for a considerably long time. It would not include a flying  visit or a short or casual presence at that place. As the parents of the  respondent were admittedly residing in District Howrah for more than 30  years, they would be treated to be &quot;ordinarily residing&quot; in that District  and the mere fact that they held some property in a village in District  Siwan in the State of Bihar would not affect their status.
