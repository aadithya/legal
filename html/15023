<meta name="DC.description" content="Dismissing the appeals, this Court    Held : 1.1. A combined reading of Section 10(2)(i), the proviso and the  explanation as found in the T.N. Rent Control Act manifests that it is only  when the Rent Controller is satisfied that a tenant's default to pay or  tender the rent is wilful, he can order eviction of the tenant. The  question of wilful default to pay or tender the rent to a landlord by a  tenant is a mixed question of law and fact. [22-A]    1.2. The appellant had withdrawn the rent deposited by the respon-dents  before the filing of the eviction petition. Having accepted the rent  deposited, the appellant cannot legitimately contend that the respondents  committed default in payment of rent of that period. That being the  position on the date the appellant filed eviction petitions against the  respondents, cause of action on the ground of wilful default in payment of  rent was not subsisting to claim their eviction from the premises. [22-D-E]    Dakaya @ Dakaiah v. Anjani, [1995] 6 SCC 500, referred to.    2.1. The ground for seeking eviction of the respondents was that the  respondents failed to tender correct rent that was termed as wilful default  in payment of rent. Such failure to tender correct rent cannot be wilful  default in payment of rent under Section 10(2) of the Act. [20-H; 21-A]    3.1. To seek eviction on the ground of denial of the title of the landlord  there should be denial of title of the landlord or claim of a right of  permanent tenancy by the tenant and such denial or claim should not be  bonafide. [23-F]    3.2. To constitute denial of title of the landlord, a tenant should  renounce his character as tenant and set up title right inconsistent with  relationship of landlord and tenant, either in himself or in a third  person. In the case of derivative title of the landlord in the absence of a  notice of transfer of title in favour of the landlord or attornment of  tenancy, a tenant's assertion that the landlord is a co-owner does not  amount to denial of his title unless the tenant has also renounced his  relationship as a tenant. [23-G]    33. The respondents neither denied the relationship of landlord and tenant  nor did they stop paying rent to the appellant nor did they set up any  claim adverse to title or interest of the appellant in themselves or a  third party and that after coming to know of the said release deed in  favour of the appellant they did not persist in their plea that he was a  co- owner, it cannot be said that the respondents denied the title of the  appellant, much less can it be said that such a denial was not bonafide  [24-F-G]    3.4. The High Court is right in coming to the conclusion that but for the  release deed the appellant would be a co-owner and so the respondents were  justified in calling the appellant as a co-owner for lack of knowledge of  the release deed and that the appellant failed to make out a case of denial  of his title to the premises by the respondents. [24-H]    4.1. The principle of equity that a person cannot approbate and reprobate  finds legislative recognition in Section 116 of the Evidence Act and  Section lll(g) of the Transfer of Property Act. It is in the light of this  principle section 10(2)(vii) of the Act has to be construed. [23-H]    CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION : Civil Appeal Nos. 6293-95 of 1998." xml:lang="en_US" />
