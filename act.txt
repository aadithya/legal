text/BDA22022008AA4452007.txt:powers under Section 11 (6) of the said Act were considered threadbare

text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:pleaded that the 1989 Act is not applicable to the petitioner on the
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:ground that the 2002 and 1978 Acts are applicable. Reference is
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:made to the definition Clauses of the 2002 Act in which the
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:the 2002 Act, the expression “railway administration” as defined in
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:1989 Act is not applicable. It is also contended that the petitioner is a
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Section 184 of the 1989 Act. The argument is fallacious and should
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:not be accepted. For the purpose of 1989 Act and for applicability of
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:provisions of the 2002 Act or 1978 Act to interpret and define the
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:expressions and terms used in 1989 Act. The judgments relied upon
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:used in 2002 Act into 1989 Act. 1989 Act is a separate enactment
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:not permissible to define “Railway Administration” under 1989 Act. It
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Section 2 (32) of 1989 Act
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:enactment or as 2002 Act stands enforced. Moreover, the expression

text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:incorporated into 1989 Act. 2002 Act is, in fact, later in point of time
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:clauses of the said Act into 1989 Act. Similarly, definition clauses in
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:1978 Act have also not been incorporated into 1989 Act. It is not
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:permissible to refer to the definition clauses of 1978 Act and 2002 Act
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:1989 Act.
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:As discussed below, 1978 Act and 2002 Act, are in
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:addition to and not in derogation of the 1989 Act.
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Section 43 of the 1978 Act reads as under:“43. Application of the Indian Railways Act,

text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Thus, Section 43 stipulates that the provisions of the said Act

text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:I may note here that when 1978 Act was enacted, Indian

text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:General Clauses Act is applicable.
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:reference to Indian Railways Act, 1890 in Section 28A (8) of Uttar

text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Clauses Act after repeal of the earlier enactment, will mean as
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:reference to 1989 Act. Thus, for the purpose of Section 43 of 1978
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Act, reference to Indian Railways Act, 1890 will mean reference to
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:1989 Act. The contention of the respondent Corporation that Section
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:43 of the 1978 Act has become dead and lifeless because it refers to
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Indian Railways Act, 1890 and not to 1989 Act is misconceived. As
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:noticed above, when 1978 Act was enacted, Indian Railways Act,
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:1890 was in force but subsequently, 1989 Act was enforced with the
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Section 2(2) of 1978 Act reference will have to be made to 1989, Act
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:in 1978 Act.
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Logically, it also follows that when Section 104 of the 2002 Act
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:makes reference to 1978 Act, it also makes reference to Section 43
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:of 1978 Act and therefore to 1989 Act. Section 104 of 2002 Act reads
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:as under:“104. Application of other Acts.- Save as
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:otherwise provided in this Act, the provisions

text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Thus, the said Section states that provisions of 2002 Act are
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:in addition and not in derogation of the 1978 Act. The provisions of
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:1978 Act continue to apply even after 2002 Act was enforced. By
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:virtue of Section 43 of the 1978 Act the provisions of 1989 Act will
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:enactment of 2002 Act. It may also be noticed here that the term
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:“Railway” for the purpose of 2002 Act has been defined in Section
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:2(P) to mean Railways as defined in Section 2 (31) of the 1989 Act.
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Section 2 (2) of 2002 Act also states that words and expressions not
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:used but defined in 1978 Act shall have the same meaning as
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:assigned to them under the Act. The legislature while enacting 1978
text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:Act and 2002 Act has followed the legislative device of “incorporation”

text/SKN07052008CW31522006.txt:of the 1978 Act. The 1989 Act continues to apply in view of Section

text/SRB02072007CW3481993.txt:procedure contemplated by s. 36 of the Act has not been followed. In our
text/SRB02072007CW3481993.txt:opinion there is no justification for this argument. Section 42 of the Act as
text/SRB02072007CW3481993.txt:amended by Act 27 of 1960 authorized the State Government to interfere
text/SRB02072007CW3481993.txt:with the scheme of consolidation or repartition made under the Act. What

text/SRB02072007CW3481993.txt:of the Act. The reason for the two different provisions in SS. 36 and 42 of
